A drop of blood fell on the snow under the window. &#39;I wish, I wish,&#39; said the queen, &#39;that I had a daughter with a skin as white as this snow, with hair as black as the ebony of this window-frame, and with lips as red as this</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">drop of blood.&#39; And what do you think? After a while a daughter was</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: left;">born, and the girl did indeed have hair as black as ebony, a skin as white as snow, and lips as red as blood. So the king and queen were quite happy, you understand,</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and they called their daughter Snow White.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">But one day the queen became ill, even so badly that she died. The king, who did not like it, so alone, after a while married again.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">His new wife was very beautiful, but what the king did not know was that she thought of nothing else all day long but being beautiful. In her room she even had a magic mirror for that purpose.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Every morning she would stand in front of this mirror and ask:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And because it was a magic mirror, he could talk, and he always answered:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You <i><b>are the most beautiful in the land .</b></i></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The queen then sat down contentedly on a chair in front of her dressing table to make herself even more beautiful.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But one day things went differently. The queen stood in front of the mirror again and asked:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_002.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And do you know what she heard now?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oh, Queen, you are the most beautiful in this room,</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">but Snow White is a thousand times more beautiful than you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The queen could not believe her ears. She pushed aside the curtain and saw Snow White playing, and knew at once that the mirror was right. &#39;No one must be more beautiful than I,&#39; the queen growled. And then she thought of something very evil.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">She called the palace hunter to her and gave him a large knife. &#39;Tomorrow you will take Snow White into the forest,&#39; she said, &#39;and there you will stab her to death with this knife.&#39; Then she gave him a small box.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;And to make sure she&#39;s dead, I want this box back with Snow White&#39;s heart in it.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The next day the huntsman went with Snow White into the forest. But when he took out his knife, he felt sorry for her. &#39;Go away, Snow White,&#39; he said, &#39;as far away as possible, because the queen wants me to kill you.&#39; Frightened, Snow White ran as fast as she could, deep into the forest. And do you know what the huntsman did? He killed a wild boar and put its heart in the queen&#39;s box.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, Snow White kept running. She ran over seven mountains until, exhausted, she came to a tiny house. The front door was not locked.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Snow White had to duck when she went inside.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">There must be seven children living here, she thought. Look, there are seven little chairs, seven little plates, seven little glasses and seven little spoons. She</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">walked up a small narrow staircase and at the top she saw seven little beds in a row. Suddenly she felt how tired she was. (Yes, what do you expect, when you have run so hard over seven mountains!) And before she knew it she was stretched out across three beds and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because of that she didn&#39;t hear the residents coming home. They weren&#39;t seven</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 272%;text-align: left;">children but seven dwarfs, and they saw right away that someone had been in the house. They crept upstairs and discovered the sleeping Snow White.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_003.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Oh, how sweet she is,&quot; said one dwarf. &quot;And how beautiful,&quot; said another.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Shhh, don&#39;t wake them!&quot; said a third. And they quietly crept back down the stairs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">After a long time Snow White woke up and when she found the seven dwarfs downstairs, she told them what had happened to her. The dwarfs had heard of the evil queen. &#39;They say she can do magic,&#39; they whispered and crept closer together.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 133%;text-align: justify;">The next morning the dwarves had to go to the silver mine to work as usual. At the door they said to Snow White: &#39;Be careful, don&#39;t let anyone in. You never know!&#39; They waved to her and disappeared behind the mountains.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, in the palace, the hunter had given the box to the evil queen.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 157%;text-align: left;">&quot;Now I&#39;m the most beautiful again,&quot; she said with satisfaction and quickly went to stand in front of the magic mirror.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 109%;text-align: left;">Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The mirror replied:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oh, Queen, you are the most beautiful in this room,</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">but Snow White is a thousand times more beautiful than you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The queen showed the box to the mirror. &#39;Ha! That can&#39;t be!</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Snow White is dead. Here is her heart!&#39; But the mirror answered:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Oh, Queen, the fairest in this room are you, but Snow White beyond the Seven Mountains in the house of the</p><p class="s5" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">Seven Dwarfs is a thousand times fairer than you!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The queen understood that the huntsman had fooled her. She trembled with rage.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_004.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Then I&#39;ll kill her myself,” she said, gritting her teeth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">She went down six flights of stairs to the cellar and there conjured up a poisoned apple. It was red on one side and green on the other. She changed herself into an old woman and set off, over the seven mountains, to the house of the seven dwarves.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;ll get her!&quot; she growled again and again. And in her basket, among the other apples, lay the poisoned apple... Snow White, who was left alone in</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">the cottage of the seven dwarfs, was just about to put a pan of soup on the fire, when there was a tap at the window. It was an old woman, who was carrying a basket of apples.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">&#39;May I rest here for a while? I am so tired,&#39; she panted. Snow White hesitated. She opened the window and said, &#39;I am sorry, old woman, the dwarves will not let anyone in. But I can give you a glass of water.&#39; When the witch had</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">finished the glass, she said, &#39;Since you have been so kind to me, I will give you an apple. Look, a very beautiful red-green apple. Take a nice</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">bite!&#39; Snow White took a bite and… fell dead on the ground.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">&#39;Hahahaha,&#39; laughed the wicked queen (for that is what it was of course!), &#39;hahahaha! Now I am the fairest of them all again!&#39; And she hurried back to her</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">palace, on the other side of the seven mountains.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">When the dwarfs came home they found Snow White lying dead on the floor. The dwarfs were deeply and deeply sad, so sad that they could not say goodbye to her. They made a beautiful glass coffin for her and put her in it, so that they could always look at her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">A few days later a prince happened to be riding through the forest on his horse and saw the glass coffin. He thought Snow White was so beautiful that he lifted the glass lid and gave her a kiss.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Apparently Snow White was not completely dead, because she started coughing in fright and the poisoned piece of apple shot out of her throat.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She sat up in surprise and asked, &quot;Where am I? What happened?&quot;</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Hurray!” shouted the dwarves.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">How happy they were that Snow White was alive again! The prince was too. He took Snow White on his horse and they rode off together to his palace.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There they got married and lived happily ever after.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">And the evil queen? She heard from the mirror that Snow White was still the most beautiful. She found that so terrible that she dropped dead.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_005.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Yes, really, she fell over in sheer rage, just like that, right there in front of the mirror.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="237" height="45" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_006.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s12" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 35pt;text-align: left;">Tom Thumb</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark3">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there lived a little boy who was so small and thin</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">was that everyone called him Tom Thumb. He had six big brothers, who</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">were all as thin as Tom Thumb, because their parents were so poor that they could not buy enough food for them. Their father was a woodcutter, but no one bought his wood, because the people in the neighborhood were all equally poor.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">One evening, Tom Thumb&#39;s stomach growled so much that he could not sleep. He crept downstairs to see if he could find a few more breadcrumbs. In the kitchen he heard his father sigh: &#39;Wife, we have no more food at all. There is nothing else for</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">it. Tomorrow I will take the children into the forest and leave them there.&#39; Tom Thumb did not know what he heard, for who would do such a terrible</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">thing?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But that&#39;s how it goes in fairy tales.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">Now Tom Thumb was very small, but also very clever, and he thought of a plan. He crept out of the door and filled his pockets with pebbles.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">The next day the father said, &#39;We&#39;re all going to the forest.&#39; And off they went, one after the other, in a long line. The father in front and Tom Thumb last of all. Every five steps he secretly dropped a pebble.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The father stopped at a stream. &#39;I&#39;m going to chop wood on the other side.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Go and play here, and I will pick you up later.&#39; When the sun had set</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">and the father did not return, the brothers began to cry. Tom Thumb said: &#39;Don&#39;t be afraid, I know the way home.&#39; And he did, because all he had to do was follow the pebbles he had dropped.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The father and mother were very happy to see them, because the father had been able to sell some wood that day and so there was bread in the house again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">But after a while it went wrong again. Nobody bought wood from the woodcutter and there they all sat at the table again in front of empty plates.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So the father brought the children the next day for the second time</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_007.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to the forest, and again Tom Thumb had his pockets full of pebbles which</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">he dropped one by one on the way. And again he could find his way home in the evening. Coincidentally, the father had also been able to earn something that day, and so everyone was happy again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">But this time too, the happiness did not last long. One day there was only half a loaf of bread left in the house, and that is really too little for nine people. Tom Thumb now knew what to do, but when he wanted to get pebbles from the garden that night, he noticed to his horror that the door was locked!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The next day the father divided the half loaf into seven pieces, one for each child, and led his sons into the forest again. Instead of pebbles, Tom Thumb now</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">dropped a crumb of bread every five steps. When it grew dark, Tom Thumb said, &#39;I don&#39;t think father will come. Let us go home. The breadcrumbs will show us the way.&#39; But guess what? Birds and mice had eaten the breadcrumbs.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There they stood! How were they going to get home?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;We can&#39;t stand here all night,&quot; said Tom Thumb. &quot;Let&#39;s try to find our own way home.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">But they got lost and went deeper and deeper into the forest, further and further from home.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The brothers grew tired and began to grumble that it was all Tom Thumb&#39;s fault, but Tom Thumb did not lose heart. He climbed a tall tree and hoped that he could see their house from there. That was not the case, but he did see a light burning in the distance.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Maybe they could get something to eat there, because they were so hungry!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">It was a very large, high house, much larger than their own. Tom Thumb knocked on the door. A friendly lady opened it.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Madam, have you got any food for us, and perhaps a place where we can sleep?&quot; asked Tom Thumb politely. &quot;Oh, poor little ones!&quot; said the woman, frightened. &quot;Don&#39;t you know that a giant lives here, who is very fond of human flesh?&quot; She thought deeply for a moment. &quot;I can&#39;t send you back into the forest, because it&#39;s already quite dark.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Do you know what? There&#39;s another bed in the room next to his seven daughters&#39;. You can sleep there.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_008.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">spend the night. But you must be very quiet, because the giant must not know that you are there.&#39; First the woman gave them a</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">bowl of soup. &#39;Eat it quickly, because the giant can come home at any moment!&#39; And hardly had she said that when the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">house began to shake. The woman jumped up and whispered anxiously: &#39;There comes the giant with his seven-league boots. With those magic boots he can take</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">steps as big as a football field. Quick, upstairs!&#39; Stumbling over each other, Tom Thumb and his brothers climbed a steep</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">staircase, following the woman. She pushed them into a room. &#39;Hurry, into bed, and remember: keep your mouths shut! His daughters are sleeping next door and the giant must not hear you.&#39; She turned around and went downstairs to let the giant in.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: justify;">Tom Thumb and his brothers crept into the big bed and held their breath. They heard the giant come in, or rather they felt him, for the whole house was in a commotion. &#39;What do I smell now?&#39; they heard him say.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&#39;Do I smell human flesh?&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">&#39;Oh no, oh no,&#39; sounded the woman&#39;s voice, a little nervous, &#39;you&#39;re just imagining it.&#39; Tom Thumb quietly climbed</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">out of bed and crept into the room of the giant&#39;s daughters. They were sleeping</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">next to each other, all in one big bed, and all seven of them had a crown on their heads. Tom Thumb carefully picked up the crowns and quietly crept back to his brothers. &#39;Put those crowns on!&#39; he whispered and before he crawled under the covers he</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">put one on his own head.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">A moment later the giant stumbled up the stairs. &#39;And yet I smell human flesh,&#39; he muttered, and he went into the room where Tom Thumb and his brothers were lying. In the dark he felt the crowns and so he thought that they were his daughters. But he was not quite sure, so he went into the room next door. &#39;You see, I have smelled human flesh,&#39; said the giant, when he felt a head with hair, and he ate all seven of his daughters one after the other. Clothes and all. It all happened so quickly that they did not even wake up! The giant threw himself on the bed and a moment later</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">he was snoring so loudly that it sounded like a big tree was being cut down.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Thumbelina and his brothers sprang out of bed and hurried down the stairs one after the other, without making a sound. In the corner of the kitchen lay the seven-league boots. Thumbelina put them on without hesitation, and, oh, wonder, they fitted perfectly. They were magic boots! He took the hand of his eldest brother, and he took the hand of his second brother, and so on,</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">and so they went with giant strides in a line through the forest. When the sun rose, Thumbelina saw a little house in the distance. &#39;Hurrah!&#39; he cried. &#39;Guys, we&#39;re back home!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">How happy the father and mother were when they saw their children again, and that Little Thumb had been so clever as to take the seven golden crowns with him. They sold them and from then on they always had enough money for food. And the father never had to leave the children in the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_009.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">forest again. Yes, that&#39;s how it goes in fairy tales...</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="490" height="37" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_010.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 26pt;text-align: left;">The Emperor&#39;s New Clothes</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 42pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark4">A LONG TIME AGO there was an emperor who had an incredible vain. Now everyone is a little vain, but this emperor really liked to look in the</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mirror, and he was also quite stupid. listen.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The emperor in this story loved nothing more than trying on new clothes.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">In fact, all he thought about was clothes all day long. He had twelve large wardrobes, and they were all crammed full. And in his palace there were mirrors everywhere.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">There were at least three in every hallway, eight in the dining room, and ten in the large drawing room, not to mention the bedroom.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">There was a huge one nailed to the ceiling, so he could even look at himself in bed, so you can imagine he often lay on his back.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Everyone in the country was talking about how vain the emperor was. Two strangers who happened to be traveling through the country and had no money in their wallets heard about it. They came up with a clever plan to make a lot of money in an easy way.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">They went to the palace and told the emperor that they could make clothes that were not only very beautiful, but also very special. The emperor immediately sat up. Of course he had to have those clothes.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What do you mean, special?” he asked.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Only smart people can see the clothes,&quot; the men explained. &quot;To stupid people they are invisible.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">So these clothes are not only beautiful and special, thought the emperor, but also very useful, because now I can find out who is stupid and who is not. And so you see that the emperor himself was not very smart. Because who would believe something like that?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The emperor ordered the two liars to begin immediately, because two weeks later there would be a large procession through the city and he wanted</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_011.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">walking ahead in his new clothes. He showed them a large room where they could set up their looms.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 134%;text-align: left;">The two men asked the emperor for handfuls of money to buy the most beautiful, the finest and therefore the most expensive yarns. But they kept that money for themselves. They bought nothing at all. Every day they went to the looms. They pretended to stretch yarn, they pretended to weave, they pretended to take the most beautiful fabrics from the looms and they pretended to make the most</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">beautiful clothes from these fabrics. But there was no fabric, there was no clothes, there was nothing at all.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The emperor was naturally very curious about what the clothes looked like. He sent his chief minister to look. One of the men let him in and pointed to the empty looms and the empty tables.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;Just look,&#39; he said, &#39;do you see how beautifully the fabrics shine? And do you see how beautiful the clothes have become there on the table?&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The prime minister looked at the empty looms and the empty tables and thought: Oh dear, I am stupid, because I don&#39;t see any clothes. But of course he didn&#39;t</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">say that out loud, because then everyone would know he was stupid. What he said was: &#39;Yes-yes-yes-yes, they are really beautiful!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">And when the emperor asked a moment later how the clothes were, the prime minister said again that they were beautiful. &#39;Aha!&#39; said the emperor to himself. &#39;So this minister is not stupid, because he can see the clothes.&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 22pt;text-align: left;">Everyone in the country heard about the two wonderful tailors and everyone talked about the emperor&#39;s new clothes. The emperor himself became more and more</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">curious, but he had to wait until the day of the great procession. Only then was he finally allowed to admire his new clothes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">With all his ministers in a row behind him, he went to the room of the two impostors. Of course, the emperor didn&#39;t see the clothes either. Oh dear, he thought, so I&#39;m</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">stupid. And of course he didn&#39;t want anyone to know that either.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;Well-well-well,&#39; he said, &#39;they are really magnificent!&#39; &#39;Yes-yes-yes,&#39; said all the ministers, who also saw nothing. &#39;They are really magnificent!&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The king undressed completely to put on the new clothes.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The two men pretended to dress him. First they put on a pair of underwear, then a</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">shirt, trousers, a jacket and the rest. Then they took a few steps back and looked at the naked emperor from head to toe.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Yes,&quot; they said, &quot;the clothes really suit you!&quot; &quot;Yes-yes-yes,&quot; cried all the ministers, &quot;the clothes really suit you!&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Proudly the emperor walked out and in his bare clothes he strode forward at the head of the procession. The streets were packed with people. Everyone was curious</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">about the emperor&#39;s new clothes and everyone shouted: &#39;Oh, oh, oh, what beautiful clothes!&#39; Because no one wants to look stupid, that was clear once again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">But suddenly there was a little boy who shouted: &#39;But he&#39;s not wearing any clothes at all!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The people around him looked at the boy in shock. And then they looked at each other again. And do you know what happens when one dares to tell the truth?</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Then suddenly others dare to do it too. So a moment later everyone shouted: &#39;The emperor walks naked, the emperor walks naked!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I&#39;m clearly not the only one who&#39;s stupid, thought the emperor. He straightened his</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_012.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">back and walked even more proudly through the people. In the nude! How do you like that!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_013.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s14" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark5">The Wolf and the Seven Little Goats</a></p><h2 style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 24pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there was once a mother goat who lived with her seven little goats lived in a house on the edge of the forest.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Very often, three times a week, mother goat had to go to the village to do the shopping, because seven little goats eat a lot, you know!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And every time before she went out she would say: &#39;Listen carefully, children, beware of the wolf! I don&#39;t have to tell you what wolves do to little goats.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">So lock the door tight when I&#39;m gone. You&#39;re only allowed to open it when it&#39;s me, and for no one else. Did you understand that?&#39; She was that careful! And she was right, because listen…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">One day, mother goat had to go shopping again. This time, someone stood behind the big tree next to the house and watched her until she disappeared around the bend. That someone crept up to the house, walked around it and sniffed at the walls and windows. You guessed it, that was the wolf!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">He knocked on the door and said in his sweetest voice, &quot;Open up, dear goats, I am your mother.&quot; Inside, the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">goats cried out in fear, &quot;No, no, you sound very different from our mother. Our mother does not have such a deep voice!&quot; They huddled together and trembled with fear.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">That&#39;s right, thought the wolf, I must speak in a high voice. He walked back to the thick tree, waited a while, and then walked back to the door.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In a high-pitched voice he said: &#39;Dear little goats, open the door, it is I, your mother.&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">That</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">sounded like their mother, the little goats thought, but to be on the safe side they called out: &#39;Then let me see your paw under the door.&#39; They shrank back,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">because through the crack under the door they saw a brown hairy paw! &#39;No, no,&#39; they cried, trembling, their eyes wide with fear, &#39;you are not our mother. Our mother has white paws!&#39; That is true, said the wolf to himself. He went to his</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">den and came back with a pot of flour. He put his paw through it and then he said:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_014.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">in a high-pitched voice: &#39;Dear goats, open the door! It is I, your mother.&#39; The goats all stood in</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">front of the door and shouted: &#39;Show me your paw!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">When they saw the white paw, they opened the door. And they shouldn&#39;t have done that...</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The wolf jumped inside. The goats screamed and flew in all directions. One crawled under the table, the second crawled behind the cupboard, the third crawled under the bed, the fourth crawled into the laundry basket, the fifth crawled behind the coat rack, the sixth crawled behind a door. The seventh crawled into the grandfather clock… The wolf found them all and ate them up immediately – all except one… Only the seventh kid, which was in the clock, he had not found.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Not long after, the mother goat returned. She had seen from a distance that the door was open, and when she found the pot of flour by the door and her goats nowhere to be seen, she began to wail terribly. &#39;Children, children,&#39; she cried, &#39;where are you?&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The seventh goat carefully emerged from the clock and told what had happened.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;One thing is certain,&quot; said mother goat, &quot;if he has eaten six of my babies, he</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">will now have a very big belly and with a big belly like that you won&#39;t get far.&quot; She grabbed a pair of</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">scissors and a sewing box and went outside. There was flour everywhere, you could see where the wolf had gone. And sure enough, a little further on he was</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">sleeping under a tree.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Look at his big belly,&quot; said mother goat to herself, &quot;that&#39;s where my darlings are.&quot; She tiptoed closer and quickly cut his belly open. The kids jumped out. Mother goat filled the belly with big stones and sewed everything up neatly. Then they all hid behind the trees.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">After a long time the wolf woke up. What a strange feeling I have in my stomach, he thought, and how thirsty I am! He walked to a stream, which was very</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 107%;text-align: left;">struggling with all those stones in his stomach, he bent over to drink, fell into the water and drowned.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Mother goat and her seven kids jumped up and down, they were so happy that the big bad wolf was dead. Relieved, they went home. They took</p><p class="s15" style="padding-bottom: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">the pot of flour inside and baked delicious pancakes with it.</p><p style="padding-left: 74pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="18" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_015.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="178" height="45" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_016.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s16" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Little Red Riding Hood</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">E</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark6">ONCE upon a time – long, long ago – there was a girl called Little Red Riding Hood.</a></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 160%;text-align: left;">That wasn&#39;t her real name, but everyone called her that because she always wore a red hood on her head.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One day her mother said to her: &#39;Little Red Riding Hood, you must go to Grandma&#39;s.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">She is ill and I have a basket of rolls, cookies and a bottle of good wine for her.&#39; Grandma lived in a small house, in the</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">middle of the forest near the big oak tree. It was far away, but Little Red Riding Hood knew the way very well.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">&quot;Remember,&quot; said Mother, &quot;to walk briskly and not to stray from the path.&quot; Little Red Riding Hood promised. She walked into the forest and indeed walked briskly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Suddenly a big wolf poked his head out from between the trees. Little Red Riding Hood greeted her politely, but kept walking briskly. &#39;Little girl, little girl,&#39; said the wolf, &#39;what a hurry! Where are you going with your basket?&#39; &#39;To grandma,&#39; answered</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Little Red Riding Hood. &#39;She is ill.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Oh? And where does Grandma live?” asked the wolf again.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">&#39;By the big oak,&#39; said Little Red Riding Hood, &#39;but please excuse me, I have no time now, I must go on. Good-bye, Mr. Wolf!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">The wolf walked along with her and said, &#39;Well, well, don&#39;t you see what a lovely day it is today? And look at all those beautiful flowers. Your grandmother will be very happy when you give her the basket of goodies and a beautiful bunch of flowers.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Little Red Riding Hood didn&#39;t know that the wolf was very hungry and that Little Red Riding Hood seemed like a tasty morsel to him. But the wolf was greedy. Now that he had</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">heard about that grandmother, he actually wanted Little Red Riding Hood and Grandma as a tasty morsel.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;I mustn&#39;t leave the path,&quot; said Little Red Riding Hood.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">&quot;Come, come!&quot; said the wolf. &quot;Isn&#39;t it for your grandmother?&quot; And when he had said that, he disappeared among the trees.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_017.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Little Red Riding Hood stood still. The wolf is right, she thought, those flowers are beautiful. She forgot her mother&#39;s advice, and… went off the path.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Meanwhile the wolf ran with great leaps to the big oak. He stopped at the little house. &#39;Grandma,&#39; he called, &#39;I am Little Red Riding Hood, will you open the door for me?&#39; &#39;I can&#39;t,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">dear,&#39; called Grandma. &#39;I am in bed. Just pull the string and the door will open by itself.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The wolf pulled the string, pushed open the door, jumped on Grandma&#39;s bed and swallowed her whole in one gulp. Then he got a nightgown out of the closet, put Grandma&#39;s nightcap on his head, put her glasses on his nose and got under the covers. It looked like he was Grandma now.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, Little Red Riding Hood was on her way again, now with a large bunch of flowers.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">At grandma&#39;s house she looked up strangely: the door was open. So she walked straight inside, to the bedroom.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She looked at her grandmother in surprise, because she looked a bit strange.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“But Grandma, what big ears you have!” she cried in surprise.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The wolf said in a high-pitched voice, &quot;That&#39;s so I can hear you better, dear.&quot; &quot;But, Grandma,&quot;</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">said Little Red Riding Hood again, &quot;what a big nose you have!&quot; &quot;That&#39;s so I can smell you better, child,&quot; said the wolf.</p><p class="s6" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;But Grandma, what big eyes you have!&quot; said Little Red Riding Hood now.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The wolf replied, &quot;That&#39;s so I can see you better, dear.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;But Grandma, what a big mouth you have!&quot; Little Red Riding Hood was amazed.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">“That&#39;s the better to eat you,” cried the wolf, who had become extremely hungry by now.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">He jumped up and ate Little Red Riding Hood in one bite, just like he had done with Grandma. Growling with satisfaction, he went back to bed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_018.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">He fell asleep right away (Yes, that&#39;s what happens when you eat that much!) and started snoring really loudly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">Now, Grandma had a good friend who was a hunter. That hunter happened to be walking past the cottage that afternoon and heard the wolf snoring.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;That&#39;s not Granny snoring like that,&#39; said the hunter to himself. &#39;Something&#39;s wrong here.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And the door&#39;s open, that&#39;s wrong too.&#39; He went inside, saw a</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">basket of goodies with a bunch of flowers next to it, saw a pair of broken glasses lying on the floor, and then he saw the wolf in the bed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">He understood at once that the wolf had eaten Grandma. And that basket, I know it, thought the hunter. That is Little Red Riding Hood&#39;s.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">Without thinking further, he grabbed his hunting knife and cut open the wolf&#39;s belly. Grandma and Little Red Riding Hood quickly stepped out. &#39;Phew, pff, it was so stuffy in there,&#39; they cried in relief.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Shhh!&quot; hissed the hunter. &quot;Shhh, we mustn&#39;t wake the wolf.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">From outside he brought three large stones, stuffed them into the wolf&#39;s belly and sewed the belly shut again. Then all three of them hid in the big wardrobe. Through a crack they</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">kept an eye on the wolf.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">After a while the wolf woke up. &#39;Oh,&#39; he groaned, rubbing his belly, &#39;I feel a little sick.&#39; (No wonder with those big rocks in his belly, but of course he didn&#39;t know that.) &#39;And how thirsty I am!&#39; The wolf dragged himself outside to the stream. He bent down to drink, but because of the heavy rocks in his belly he fell forward into the water and drowned.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Hurray!” shouted Little Red Riding Hood, the huntsman, and Grandma, who had seen it all.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Grandma quickly went back under the covers, because she was still not feeling</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">well. The huntsman and Little Red Riding Hood both took a chair and the three of them ate the rolls and cookies with relish and drank the wine of Little Red Riding Hood&#39;s mother.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">&quot;Mmmmmm!&quot; said Grandma. &quot;Your mother sure can bake delicious cookies, Little Red Riding Hood!&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="19" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_019.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">The hunter and Little Red Riding Hood also wanted to say something, but their mouths were full.

Everyone knows that.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="356" height="45" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_020.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s17" style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The worn out shoes</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">E</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark7">R ONCE there was a king who had eleven daughters. Was he happy with them? Yes</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 36pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">and no. Yes, because he was quite proud of all those beautiful girls. And no, because they gave him a headache. He was puzzled. For weeks he had to buy new shoes for his eleven daughters every day. Eleven pairs of shoes every day, that&#39;s seventy-seven pairs of shoes in one week. And why? Because the shoes he had bought the day before were already worn out the next day: the soles were hanging loose,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the heels were worn crooked, the straps torn, and so on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">How could that happen? How did those shoes become completely worn out and broken in one night? And it was even weirder when you knew that the king locked his daughters in their bedroom every night at exactly eight o&#39;clock. They couldn&#39;t go anywhere!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">When he asked, the eleven daughters lowered their eyes and remained silent in all languages. The king was completely mad about it. And all those shoes cost him a lot of money. In desperation, the king placed an advertisement in the newspaper.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Whoever solved the riddle of the worn-out shoes was allowed to marry one of the princesses. You were allowed to spend three nights in the girls&#39; bedroom, but if you still hadn&#39;t solved the riddle, your head was chopped off.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Weeks passed. Many men had tried to solve the riddle, but they had all fallen asleep at some point and so they could not say how all those shoes had become worn out.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">A soldier, who was no longer so young and had been wounded in the war, wanted to try it too. But first he went to an old wise woman for advice.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The woman gave him a cloak that made you invisible when you put it on. And she also gave him some wise advice: &#39;Be especially careful that you</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_021.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;Don&#39;t drink</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">anything!&#39; The soldier didn&#39;t quite understand this, but he decided to follow her advice anyway.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The next day he knocked on the palace gate. The king let him in and said that he hoped that the riddle would now finally be solved.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">When the clock struck eight, the princesses went to bed. The soldier got the key to the bedroom and locked himself in with the princesses.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He put the key in his pocket.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, the girls were getting ready for the night. The youngest gave the soldier a glass of red wine. &#39;You were wounded, weren&#39;t you?&#39; she said kindly. &#39;You really need to get some strength. A good glass of wine will do you good!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The soldier was very thirsty and was about to take a sip, when he remembered what the wise woman had said: &#39;Take care that you do not drink anything!&#39; So he secretly emptied the glass into a vase. A moment later the youngest princess led him to a nice soft bed. The soldier lay down and closed his eyes. The magic cloak lay rolled up beside him.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The light went out and for a long time nothing happened. The soldier decided to pretend to be asleep and started snoring.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">And sure enough, the light went on again. He heard whispering and rustling everywhere.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">&quot;That old man would have fallen asleep without our sleeping pill,&quot; joked one of the princesses.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The soldier opened one eye very cautiously and saw that the girls were all taking ball gowns out of the closets. They were dressing themselves, making themselves pretty, and pinning pearls, ribbons and flowers in their hair, and everywhere</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">there was the tinkling of bracelets and necklaces.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">When they were done, the eldest princess knocked on her bed, whereupon it sank into the floor. The princesses disappeared one after the other into the hole that had been created. The soldier put on his magic cloak and went after them.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">By a staircase they came into a dark underground passage. The soldier, who was now invisible, could not see his hand before his face, but he heard the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_022.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">the rustle of dresses and the excited whispering and giggling of the girls.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">One said, &#39;I don&#39;t know, but I have a feeling that we are being followed.&#39; &#39;Oh, no,&#39; said</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">another, &#39;you&#39;re just imagining it.&#39; The soldier could hardly keep</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">up with the girls. After a while the passage opened into a beautiful orchard. The trees there had silver leaves. In a second orchard were trees with golden leaves, and in</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">a third the trees had diamond leaves! In the bright moonlight the princesses ran on to a large lake. Eleven boats were waiting for them there, and in each boat sat a prince.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The princesses got in. The soldier got into the boat with the youngest princess. &#39;I don&#39;t understand it at all,&#39; said the prince, &#39;today it&#39;s much harder to row than usual. I think I&#39;ve eaten too much.&#39;</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">On the other side they climbed up the bank and disappeared into a large castle. In a beautiful ballroom music sounded and there they began to dance, the handsome princes and the beautiful princesses.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">laughing and joking they glided across the dance floor, turning gracefully and bowing gracefully; their ball gowns swung in all directions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">This went on for hours. They didn&#39;t stop once to catch their breath. They filled their glasses with champagne while dancing. At exactly four o&#39;clock it was suddenly over. Everyone hurried to the boats. The princesses ran</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">through the three orchards, ran through the underground passage, climbed the stairs, back to the bedroom. The soldier had run ahead of them, so when the first princess climbed into the room, he was already lying in his bed, pretending to snore.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: justify;">The princesses hung their ball gowns back in the closets. The soldier felt someone take the key from his pocket. There was a soft pacing, the door was opened and closed again. The key was put back in his pocket.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The next morning all the shoes were in a pile in front of the bedroom door.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">All broken and worn out. Danced to pieces!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_023.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The soldier now knew the secret. But he said nothing to the king, for he was quite willing to experience the strange adventure again.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The second night it was the same. The princesses all put on ball gowns again, even more beautiful than the ones from the night before, and set off again. In the underground passage the soldier accidentally stepped on the train of the youngest princess. She gave a little cry of fright</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and said: &#39;I have the feeling that we are</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">not alone.&#39; &#39;Oh, what nonsense,&#39; cried the others, &#39;you are only imagining it.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Outside, clouds raced across a dark sky, but inside the castle the chandeliers were lit and they were dancing again as if their lives depended on it, their faces red from the champagne and excitement. The soldier wanted to</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">join in and took the youngest princess&#39;s hand. The girl gave a little shriek. &#39;Someone&#39;s here!&#39; she cried.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">&quot;Oh no,&quot; said the prince with whom she was dancing, &quot;you&#39;re just imagining it.&quot; When the party was over, the girls all ran back to their bedrooms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">And the next morning the king found another pile of worn-out shoes in front of the bedroom door!</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Again the soldier said nothing to the king.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The third night a strong wind blew. In every orchard the soldier broke off a twig, and each time the youngest princess looked around in alarm. &quot;Do you hear that? We are being followed, I tell you.&quot;</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">&quot;Oh no,&quot; cried the others, &quot;you are imagining it.&quot; In the ballroom the soldier took a silver cup and put that too in his pocket.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">By dawn everyone was in bed. And the danced to pieces shoes were again in a pile in front of the door.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The next day, when the king asked him if he had solved the riddle, the soldier told him everything.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The princesses were called, and of course they said that the soldier was lying. But then the soldier produced a silver, a gold, and a diamond branch. And also a silver cup. The</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">princesses burst into tears, for they understood that their secret had been discovered was.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Now you may choose a princess,” said the king.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The soldier chose the youngest one. He thought it was the prettiest.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">She wasn&#39;t really happy about it, because she thought he was much too old. But hey, when you&#39;re a princess, you can&#39;t just marry whoever you want. No, your father chooses for you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">The princesses never danced again, or at least not for nights on end. They had been bewitched all that time, and when the secret was discovered, the spell was broken. The people of the country were happy. They now had to pay less taxes, because now that the king did not have to buy eleven new pairs of shoes every day, there was enough money in the treasury.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_024.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_025.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 81pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark8">Rumpelstiltskin</a></p><h2 style="padding-top: 16pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 22pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there was once a miller who was very proud of</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">his daughter. He thought she was the most beautiful, sweetest, and prettiest girl in</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">the whole world. He boasted that she could do anything – whatever you could think of, she could do.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">&#39;Can she really do anything?&#39; someone once asked. &#39;Can she spin gold out of straw?&#39; &#39;Of course she can,&#39; said the miller without batting an eyelid.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He shouldn&#39;t have said that, because a) it wasn&#39;t true, and b) that</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">person told the king. And that king was very greedy, especially when it came to gold. So the girl had to come to the palace right away.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The king led her into a little room in the attic. There were three bundles of straw on the floor, and a spinning wheel. &#39;I will come and see you tomorrow,&#39; he said, &#39;and if you have not spun gold from that straw, I will have your head</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">cut off.&#39; He went out of the room and locked the door behind him.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">The girl was left behind in shock. She looked at the bundles of straw and burst into tears, because making gold from straw was of course not something she could do – who</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">could, anyway?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">As tears streamed down her cheeks, she suddenly heard a little voice saying, “Why are you crying, girl?” Before her stood a very small, dwarf-like man.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">&quot;If I don&#39;t spin all this straw into gold by tomorrow, my head will be chopped off,&quot; sobbed the girl.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">&quot;I can help you,&quot; said the little man, &quot;for I can spin straw into gold. But as a reward I want that little chain you have around your neck.&quot; &quot;That is good,&quot; said the girl. She quickly took off her little chain and gave it to him.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The little man put her to sleep, and when she woke up the next morning and opened her eyes, she had to close them again immediately, because the little room shone with gold!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The door opened and the king came in. &#39;Well, well, girl,&#39; he said, rubbing his hands, &#39;you have done well!&#39; But did you think that he would</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_026.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">was satisfied? No! Now he had six bundles of straw brought, and he said: &#39;Tomorrow I will come and see, and if that straw has not turned into gold, I will have your head cut off.&#39; And again the door was locked.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The girl began to cry again, and there was the dwarf again. This time he wanted her bracelet. When he had got it, he put her to sleep again and changed the straw into gold.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">But even with six piles of gold the king was not satisfied. Now she was taken to another, larger room, which was filled to the ceiling with straw.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">&#39;See you tomorrow!&#39; he said to the girl. &#39;You know what will happen if you do not spin gold from it. But I will make it up to you: if you do spin gold from it, you may marry the prince tomorrow.&#39; And with these words he locked the door. The girl was in despair. For what if the dwarf did not come? But there he was again, fortunately.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">&quot;I have nothing left to give you,&quot; the girl sobbed. &quot;You already have my necklace and my bracelet.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The little man thought for a moment. &#39;If I understand correctly,&#39; he said, &#39; <i><b>you </b></i>may marry the prince tomorrow, if <i><b>I </b></i>change the straw into gold. That is fine with me, but I will have your first child as a reward.&#39; The girl was so</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">afraid that her head would be cut off that she thought no more of it and hastily said, &#39;Yes, yes, I promise!&#39;</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The little man put her to sleep again and the next day all the straw had turned into gold.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The miller&#39;s daughter married the prince and after a while a baby was born. The girl, who was now a princess, was overjoyed. But who was suddenly standing in front of her? The dwarf!</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“I&#39;ve come to collect my reward,” he said.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The girl began to cry terribly, for she loved her child dearly, but that made no impression on the little man. &#39;A promise is a promise,&#39; he said.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The girl fell on her knees and said that she was now rich and that he could</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">have all the chains and bracelets she had, if only she could keep the child. Then the little man felt sorry for her and he</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_027.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">said, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll give you a chance. If you can guess my name within three days, you can keep your baby.&quot; And as suddenly as he had come, he was gone again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Immediately the princess asked all the footmen, maids and ladies-in-waiting, yes everyone in the palace, for their names and she wrote them all down. When the dwarf came to the palace the next day, the princess was ready with a long list of names. &#39;Well?&#39; said the dwarf. &#39;What is my name?&#39; The princess began at the top of the list. &#39;Is your</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">name Frederik?&#39; &#39;No,&#39; said the little man.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">“Is your name Leopold?” asked the princess. “No,” said the little man.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">And so it went on. When she had read out all the names, she had not guessed the name of the little man.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Remember,” said the little man, “I will come again tomorrow!” And off he went.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Now all the servants of the palace had to go out into the country and write down the names of all the people.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">The next day the little man was there again and said: &#39;Well? What is my name?&#39; The princess now had twenty times as many names as the first time.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">&quot;Is your name Alfonso? Is your name Arid? Is your name Jojo? Is your name Samson?&quot; Each time the little man said,</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">&quot;No!&quot; And again the princess had not guessed the name. “Tomorrow is your last chance,” the little man warned.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The princess was at her wits&#39; end, for where else should she find names? She</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">wandered sadly through the park around the palace. When it grew dark and she wanted to return home, she suddenly heard someone singing. Where did it come from? In the</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">distance, between the trees, she saw a fire burning and something small jumping up and down around it. When she crept closer, she saw that it was the dwarf! She quietly hid behind a thick tree. And this was what the dwarf sang:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oh, I&#39;m glad, oh,</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">I&#39;m glad, that no one knows my</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">name is Rumpelstiltskin!</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: -1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">You can imagine that the princess slept soundly that night – for the first time in two days.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The next day the little man stood before her, grinning.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Well?&quot; he said. &quot;This is your last chance, what&#39;s my name?&quot;</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">The princess pretended to have another long list of names and began: &quot;Is your name… Dabberbeard?&quot; &quot;No, no,&quot; said the</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">little man, rubbing his hands, &quot;no, that&#39;s not my name.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;Is your name… Froepeltroepje?&#39; &#39;No, no,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ha-ha, no, no!&#39; The little man was already walking to the crib.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Is your name perhaps… Rumpelstiltskin?&quot; The little man looked at her first in astonishment, then in disappointment, and then very angry. He got so angry that he exploded!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">That was terrible for the little man, but the princess was overjoyed. She took her baby out of the cradle and danced around the room.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">That afternoon the prince came in, who had not noticed the whole drama. &#39;We still have to think of a name for our son,&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The girl took a pile of papers from the drawer. &#39;I have already collected a lot of names.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We can choose from them.&#39; The prince gave</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">her a kiss and said: &#39;That&#39;s what I find so special about you, you always think of everything.&#39; And so the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">miller&#39;s daughter lived happily ever after with her prince and the baby.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 85pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_028.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="205" height="37" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_029.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s21" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 29pt;text-align: left;">Mother Holle</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark9">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there was a woman who had two daughters.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 34pt;line-height: 141%;text-align: left;">One was blond, the other had black hair, and I don&#39;t know why, but she loved the blond daughter very much and hated the other one. And yet the blond girl was terribly lazy and moody, and the dark girl very sweet and kind!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The lazy girl was spoiled, she was allowed to lie on the couch all day. The dark daughter, on the other hand, had to work from early morning until late at night. And there was plenty to do: scrubbing the floors, washing the windows and polishing the pots, pans, spoons, knives and forks until they shone like the sun.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">One day the little girl with the dark hair was polishing the cutlery again. To her horror a spoon slipped from her hands and fell into the well.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The mother became furious. &#39;You take that thing back!&#39; she snapped. &#39;I don&#39;t care how!&#39; And she went back to her embroidery.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">The poor girl, who was terrified of her mother, closed her eyes tightly and jumped into the deep well. She fell and fell and fell and fell and fell and fell and fell and as she fell, you won&#39;t believe it, she fell asleep!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">When she woke up, she was lying in a park. Everywhere were neatly raked flower beds and straight trees. Somewhere she heard someone calling softly: &#39;Get us out,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">get us out.&#39; The girl looked around curiously. Behind her was a small oven. There were rolls in it and they were calling: &#39;Get us out, get us out. We&#39;re still burning!&#39; The girl quickly took the rolls out of the oven and placed them neatly next to each other</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">on a table.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Thank you, girl, you won&#39;t regret it,” the buns said gratefully.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“You&#39;re welcome,” said the girl cheerfully and walked on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">A little later she came to an apple tree, which was sighing heavily. &#39;I&#39;m completely bent over, there are so many ripe apples hanging on me, I wish</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_030.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">someone picked</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">them.&#39; The girl quickly picked all the apples.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Thank you, girl,&quot; said the apple tree, now standing upright. &quot;You won&#39;t regret it.&quot; &quot;No thanks,&quot; said the girl,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and went on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">She walked through a gate and came to a little house. In front of the house stood an old woman. &#39;I am Mother Holle,&#39; she said. &#39;I have sprained my ankle and now I cannot clean my house. Won&#39;t you come and work for me? I will reward you well.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Of course the girl wanted to help her and she was used to working.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">But the woman had a special request. She had to shake up the pillows of the beds, because if she did that, it would snow for the people on earth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The girl immediately grabbed the broom and, singing, cleaned the house from top to bottom. She shook the pillows as if her life depended on it and the feathers flew around.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;My, my,&#39; said the people on earth, &#39;this is quite a snowstorm!&#39; One day the little woman said: &#39;It is</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">time for you to go home again. I have seen that you are a nice girl and that you like to help everyone, so I will reward you well. Just walk through that little gate. And here is your spoon back.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">When the girl walked under the gate, gold rained down on her. She was completely covered by it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">When she got home, the mother covered her mouth with her hands in astonishment.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Oh no!&quot; she cried. &quot;Where did you get all that gold?&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The girl told her about the rolls, the apple tree, and Mother Holle.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The mother, who was crazy about gold, quickly went to her favorite daughter and said, &#39;You must also jump into the well, and then you will get gold too.&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The blond girl didn&#39;t feel like it at all, but her mother pulled her off the bench, threw a spoon in the well and pushed her daughter after it. She too fell asleep while falling, she too woke up in the park and she too heard the rolls begging to be taken out of the oven.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">But the girl said sharply: &#39;And my fingers are burning, I suppose? I have better things to do.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">She walked on and snapped at the apple tree: &#39;I don&#39;t feel like picking all those apples. Do it yourself.&#39; She walked under the gate and came to Mother Holle.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Mother Holle also asked the blond girl if she could help with the housework and if she would especially shake up the cushions. The girl of course did not feel like doing that at all, but she thought of the gold and so she said yes. But Mother Holle also lay on the couch all day and did not do a thing. She did not sweep the floors and she did not clean the pans. The house became dirtier and dirtier, and she only half shook up the cushions.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What miserable snow this is!” said the people of Earth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">After three days the girl had had enough and told Mother Holle that she wanted to go home. &#39;That&#39;s okay,&#39; said Mother Holle. &#39;Here&#39;s your spoon back, and just walk through the gate and you&#39;ll get what you deserve.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">But what fell on her wasn&#39;t gold, no, what fell on her was pitch! Thick, black, sticky, viscous, gooey strings of pitch!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="19" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_031.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">When she got home, her mother covered her mouth in fear. She didn&#39;t recognize her own daughter anymore. And no matter what they did, no matter how hard they tried, the tar wouldn&#39;t come off!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, there you have it: that&#39;s what happens when you&#39;re lazy and unkind.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="234" height="45" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_032.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The miracle bottle</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark10">ANG, LONG AGO there was a farmer. He was a very good farmer.</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 34pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">man, who did no harm to anyone, but he was not very clever. No matter how hard he worked, he remained very poor. His vegetables withered in his garden, his only sheep got sick and died, and all he had left was a cow.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">One day there was no more food in the house. &#39;It&#39;s a pity,&#39; said his wife, &#39;but we must sell the cow. Then we can at least buy some food again.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The next morning the farmer was walking with the cow to the market. On the way, on a quiet path, a man came walking next to him. The farmer immediately felt very uncomfortable, because it looked like the man was walking, but if you looked closely you could see that he was floating a little above the ground.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">“This must be a magician,” said the farmer to himself, and walked a little faster, but the man stayed close to him.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">After a while the man said, &#39;You are going to the market to sell your cow because you have no food at home for your wife and children.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The farmer was shocked. Now he knew for sure: this was a wizard! “How do you know that?” he asked in a small voice.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 157%;text-align: left;">In response, the strange man took a bottle out of his pocket. &#39;Look,&#39; he said, &#39;if you give me that cow, you will get this bottle.&#39; &#39;A bottle? But isn&#39;t a cow worth much more than a bottle?&#39; said the farmer, for he wasn&#39;t that stupid.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">&#39;That&#39;s true,&#39; said the man, &#39;but this is no ordinary bottle. It&#39;s a magic bottle.&#39; You see,</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">thought the farmer, a magic bottle! So it&#39;s a magician after all!</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;Listen,&#39; the man continued. &#39;You sell that cow at the market, you get some money</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">for it, and after a few days the money is gone. Then you&#39;re back where you started. This bottle will last you much longer.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_033.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“But my wife will be very angry if I come home with a bottle,” said the farmer.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Yes, I think so too,&quot; said the strange man. &quot;But if she starts to whine, tell her to sweep the floor, put a tablecloth on the table, and put the bottle in the middle of the table.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then you&#39;ll see. Trust me. You&#39;re a good man, that&#39;s why I&#39;m doing this for you.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The farmer suddenly became very afraid. Imagine if he were to bewitch me if I didn&#39;t do what</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">he wanted, he thought. So he quickly said: &#39;All right, give me the bottle.&#39; And so the man got the cow,</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">and the farmer got the bottle. And yes, of course! At home the woman began to rage and rant. She called him all kinds of ugly names. Because what good was an empty bottle?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">The man looked down at his shoes in defeat and quietly told her to sweep the floor, put a tablecloth on the table and put the bottle in the middle of the table. Just as the man had told him.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The woman threw her hands up to the sky. &#39;Man, how can you be so stupid! Sweep the floor, put down a tablecloth, and then? We still don&#39;t have any food?!&#39; Screaming, she swept</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the floor, put down a tablecloth, and put the bottle in the middle of the table.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And what happened then…</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">They couldn&#39;t believe their eyes. Two little men climbed out of the bottle and put plates full of goodies on the table. And when they were done, they disappeared back into</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">the bottle. The woman called the children and they all ate their fill. Then they waited with excitement to see if the men would take the plates away. But that didn&#39;t happen.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: -1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">You can imagine that they now put the bottle on the table every now and then, because they had never eaten so well. They ate the most delicious things five times a day, and they started to look healthy.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And they had another advantage: they now had cupboards full of dishes. They sold them at the market and made a lot of money with that. The whole family wore the best clothes and they moved to a big farm with lots of cows, sheep and horses.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_034.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">A rich man, who also lived in the village, visited the farmer and asked how it was possible that he was so rich. The farmer told him all about the miracle bottle.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“May I borrow it for a day?” asked the rich man.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">“Yes, of course, with pleasure,” said the farmer, who may not have been smart, but was very kind.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The rich man took the bottle and quickly walked back to his house. He told his wife</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">to sweep the floor and put down a tablecloth and put the bottle in the middle of it. And there came the two little men with plates full of pies, roast turkey legs, puddings</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">and chips. Now this was nothing special for the rich man and his wife. They ate a pudding or a pie or a turkey every day. But this they got for free, without paying for it. So the rich man wanted the bottle.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The next day he took an ordinary bottle from the cellar, which looked exactly like the magic bottle. He gave it to the farmer and said: &#39;Here is your bottle back. I believe it has lost its magic power, because it did nothing at all.&#39; When the rich man had</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">gone, the farmer swept the floor, laid a tablecloth and put the bottle in the middle of the table. And indeed… nothing happened.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Well,&quot; said the farmer, &quot;we&#39;ve had a lot of fun with it.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the next part of the story you can hear that the farmer was really not very smart.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">He had gotten used to buying everything he wanted, and now that he couldn&#39;t do that anymore, he didn&#39;t know what to do. So he sold the nice clothes first, then the nice furniture, and finally the big farm. He got poorer and poorer, and after a while they were living in a hut again and they only had one cow.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The farmer saw only one solution. I&#39;ll sell the cow at the market, he thought, and maybe I&#39;ll meet that magician again on the way.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">He took the same path and… sure enough, there he was again, in exactly the same spot.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The wizard took another bottle from under his cloak, and asked, &#39;Your cow for this bottle?&#39;</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">The farmer, of course, said yes at once, and as he was already running home, the wizard called after him: &#39;My bottles never lose their magic! &#39; At home the</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">farmer swept the floor, laid a tablecloth on the table, and placed the bottle in the middle of it.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But now not two little men came out of the bottle, but two guys with clubs and they beat</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">the farmer and his wife up like crazy. more was.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After a while they disappeared back into the bottle.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">The farmer and his wife lay groaning on the floor. The woman felt a lump on her forehead and groaned, &#39;Didn&#39;t you say that the magician said that his bottles never lose their magic power? Well, then the rich man has fooled you!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: justify;">The farmer took the second bottle to the rich man, who now lived in a beautiful, palatial house, and rang the doorbell. A servant opened the door. The farmer asked if he could speak to the rich man. But the rich man had him chased off the property.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">&quot;Don&#39;t do that! Don&#39;t do that!&quot; cried the farmer. &quot;Tell your master I have another bottle for him.&quot; The rich</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">man heard this and came straight to the door, patted the farmer heartily on the shoulder and let him in. His wife swept the floor, laid down a tablecloth, and the farmer put the bottle in the middle of the table. They waited with great anticipation, and lo and</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">behold! Out came the two fellows and beat the rich man and his wife black and blue.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">&#39;Make them stop!&#39; cried the rich man. &#39;Ouch, ow! make them stop!&#39; &#39;Only if I get my magic bottle back,&#39; said the farmer.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 132%;text-align: left;">The rich man pointed to a cupboard. &#39;There, on the top shelf! Take him, take him! Ouch! Ouch!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The farmer could now buy everything again. But he had become wiser.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">He no longer bought anything, but now learned how to grow vegetables and how to keep sheep and cows healthy. So after a while he didn&#39;t need the bottle at all and he could earn his own bread.</p><p style="padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="18" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_035.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_036.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s23" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;"><a name="bookmark11">Hansel and Gretel</a></p><h2 style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 23pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there was a woodcutter and his wife</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 34pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">and their two children, Hansel and Gretel. They were so poor that they always were hungry. One day the mother had had enough. &#39;We have no more food for</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">the children,&#39; she said to her husband. &#39;I can&#39;t stand to see them hungry any longer. Tomorrow you will take them into the forest and leave them there.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">No sooner said than done. The next morning the father took the children into the forest. He stopped at a clearing. &#39;I&#39;m going to chop wood a little further on,&#39; he said, &#39;and you&#39;ll stay here until I come back.&#39; The last bit of dry bread he had,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">he left with the children, of course.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The sun was setting and Hansel and Gretel were getting cold. And their father never showed up.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">&quot;He may have forgotten,&quot; said Hans, &quot;but that doesn&#39;t matter, because I know the way home.&quot; And he took his sister by the hand.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">But under the tall trees it was very dark and because of that they got lost. They got further and further from home. They walked half the night - with growling stomachs, I can tell you, because one piece of dry bread for a whole day and half a night is not much.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Suddenly Hans saw a house in the distance. It was a very special house.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The walls were made of cake and the roof was made of marzipan. Gretel broke off a piece of the roof and was about to put it in her mouth, when a trembling little voice sounded from the house:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s20" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Nibble, nibble, little</p><p class="s20" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">mouse, who&#39;s nibbling on my house?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Gretel replied in shock:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_037.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s7" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 176%;text-align: left;">That&#39;s what the wind does, that&#39;s what the wind does, that the house likes so much.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The door of the cottage creaked open and an old woman stumbled out. &#39;Do you eat</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">from my cottage?&#39; she asked. &#39;Are you so hungry, little children?&#39; She shook her head pityingly. &#39;But cake isn&#39;t food, is it? Come in and I&#39;ll give you a bowl of hearty soup.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">It was nice and warm inside. They had finished the soup in no time and all that walking had made them so tired that they almost fell asleep over their plates. The kind old woman tucked them into bed, under a soft, woolen blanket.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The next day, before dawn, the old woman shook them awake. Suddenly she</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">was no longer nice and friendly. And she didn&#39;t hobble anymore either. She even turned out to be very strong. She dragged Hans out of bed and locked him in a cage. She threw the key on top of a cupboard.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;And you,&#39; she said to Gretel, pushing her against the wall, &#39;you will clean the house here. You will work until you drop. You didn&#39;t think you could eat from my little house with impunity, did you?&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The old woman was actually a mean witch, you may have already understood that. Gretel had to do all the work in the house. The only thing she didn&#39;t have to do was cook, because the witch did that herself. And not just cook, no, she prepared the</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">tastiest things. The strange thing was that she didn&#39;t eat any of it herself. And Gretel only got crusts of bread. No, all the goodies were for Hans. That&#39;s how it went the first</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">day and every day after that.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">After a few weeks the witch said to Hans one evening, &#39;Put your finger through the bars!&#39; She felt it and muttered, &#39;Not thick enough, not thick enough.&#39; Gretel heard this, and when the witch was asleep, she crept quietly to Hans in his cage.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">&quot;I believe the witch is fattening you up,&quot; she whispered. &quot;She wants you to get really fat, because she wants to eat you. If she asks you to take out your finger again,</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_038.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">&#39;You have to stick this through the bars.&#39; And she gave him a thin, gnawed chicken bone. Then she quickly crawled back into bed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">A few days later the witch said to Hans again, &#39;Put out your finger.&#39; Hans stuck the chicken bone through the bars. Fortunately the witch had bad eyesight, and so she thought it was Hans&#39; finger. She felt the bone, shook her head and mumbled again, &#39;Not fat enough, not fat enough.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But after a while the witch became impatient. &#39;I don&#39;t understand it. I cook the</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">most delicious snacks for him and he doesn&#39;t get fat. And I&#39;m getting such a craving for boy meat. Do you know what? I won&#39;t wait any longer, I&#39;ll eat him today.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">A skinny boy can be tasty too, if you prepare it properly.&#39; She already lit the oven and looked in her cookbook again to see how to roast a boy. &#39;Grietje,&#39; she called in the meantime, &#39;check if the oven is hot enough.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Gretel had long since understood what the witch was planning, and she said, &#39;I don&#39;t know how to do it.&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;You don&#39;t know anything either,&#39; grumbled the witch, &#39;I&#39;ll show you how to do it.&#39; She opened the oven door, stuck her head in, and snapped, &#39;That&#39;s how you do it, you stupid goose!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now you can say what you like about Gretel, but she was not a stupid goose.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She knew immediately what to do. She pushed the witch all the way into the oven and</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">quickly latched the door. The witch screamed bloody murder, but Gretel paid no attention. She pushed a chair to the high cupboard to get the key to the cage and in a jiffy she had freed Hans.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Together they searched the house and guess what they found? Gold coins! Gold coins and precious stones! Drawers and cabinets, everything was full of gold and precious stones. That wicked witch was, after all, filthy rich!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Hansel and Gretel did not think long about it. They stuffed as much of the gold and gems as they could into their pockets and ran into the forest, far away from the cake and marzipan house. They did not even dare to look back.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">look. They kept running, so afraid were they that the witch would come after them. After all, you never knew with witches. But at last they could go</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">no further and let themselves fall down on the moss, panting. Just when they thought they would never get home, Hans suddenly saw where they were. &#39;Gretel,&#39; he said, &#39;I think this path leads to our house.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="19" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_039.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">And he was right! A little later they knocked on the door of their house. The father and mother were very happy to see their children again, because they were very sorry for what they had done. They sold the gold and the precious stones and then there was enough money to buy bread, enough for a thousand years!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="271" height="45" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_040.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s24" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 37pt;text-align: left;">Puss in Boots</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">H</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 50pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark12">A LONG, long time ago and far away from here there once was a</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 43pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">miller who had three sons. &#39;When I die,&#39; he always said, &#39;my eldest son may have the mill, the second my donkey, and the third my cat.&#39; So when the man was dead and buried,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">the eldest son went to live in the mill, the second son got the donkey, and the third son got the cat.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;Well, that&#39;s a fine thing,&#39; said the third son to himself. &#39;My eldest brother can make money with the mill, my second brother can make money with the donkey, but how can I make money with a cat?&#39; He sighed deeply and looked sadly ahead.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">The cat walked up to him on its soft paws and then, to the boy&#39;s great surprise, began to talk! &#39;Perhaps it is true,&#39; said he, &#39;that you cannot make money with me, but believe it or not, I can make you rich.&#39; Of course the boy did not believe that.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“First, buy me some nice boots,” said the cat.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">What on earth does a four-legged cat need with one pair of boots? thought the boy. But he can talk, so who knows what else he can do.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And with his last cents he bought a pair of boots.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The cat stood on his hind legs, put on the boots and looked at himself in the mirror. He took a few steps to the left and a few steps to the right, nodded</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">approvingly, put his master&#39;s hat on his head and walked out the door to carry out his plan.

With these he went to the king&#39;s palace. To one of the footmen he said: &#39;Tell the king that these carp are a gift from the Marquis of Carabas.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_041.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The next day the cat caught two partridges. Again he went to the king&#39;s palace. &#39;Give</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">these to the king,&#39; said the cat to the footman, &#39;and say that they are a present from the Marquis of Carabas.&#39; &#39;The king says that he wishes to speak</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to you himself,&#39; said the footman, and he brought the cat to the king.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The king greeted the cat warmly: &#39;Well, well, another gift from the Marquis of Carabas. He must be a very nice man. Will you give him my regards and thank him very much?&#39;</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Not long after, the cat heard that the king and his</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">daughter, the princess, were going for a carriage ride along the lake.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cat hurried to his master. &#39;Get dressed quickly, we&#39;re going to the lake.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">When they got there, they hid behind some bushes. &#39;If you want to be rich, do exactly as I say,&#39; whispered the cat. The miller&#39;s son didn&#39;t understand it, but</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nodded obediently. Because he wanted to be rich!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">After a while there was the sound of hoofbeats: the king&#39;s carriage was approaching. &#39;Quick, jump into the water, now!&#39; whispered the cat, and he himself ran out into the road, waving his paws wildly. &#39;Help, help!&#39; he shouted. &#39;The Marquis of Carabas is drowning, the Marquis of Carabas is drowning! Help, help!&#39; The king stopped the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">carriage and said: &#39;The Marquis of Carabas? Isn&#39;t that the kind gentleman who gave me those carp and partridges? Of course we must help them immediately.&#39; The miller&#39;s son was pulled out of the water and given dry</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">clothes. But that was not all. He was allowed to ride in the carriage and so came to sit next to the princess.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The cat had not waited for all this and had run ahead in the meantime. When he came to vast cornfields, he asked the farmers who were working there: &#39;Whose cornfields are these?&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">“From the great wizard who lives in the castle beyond the forest,” one of the peasants replied, pointing into the distance.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_042.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The cat said, &#39;The king will soon pass by. When he asks who these cornfields</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">belong to, you must say, &quot;The Marquis of Carabas.&quot; If you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll bite your head off.&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The farmers were a little afraid of a</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">cat that could talk and walk upright like a human being and wear boots, so they promised to do it. And off the cat went again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">A little later the king&#39;s carriage arrived at the cornfields and indeed the king asked the farmers whose beautiful fields these were.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Those belong to the Marquis of Carabas,” they said.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Well, well,&quot; said the king, looking at the miller&#39;s son in surprise. &quot;Well, well,&quot; he said again, and the princess nodded kindly to him too.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The miller&#39;s son was of course as surprised as the king, but he said nothing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Meanwhile the cat had come to the great forest, and asked the forester who was working there, &#39;Whose forest is this?&#39; &#39;The great magician who</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">lives in the castle over that hill,&#39; answered the forester.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The cat said, &#39;The king will come by soon. If he asks who this forest belongs to, you must say, &quot;The Marquis of Carabas.&quot; And if you don&#39;t, I&#39;ll bite your head off.&#39; The forest ranger was also</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a little afraid of a cat wearing boots, so he promised to say so. And the cat ran on.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And there came the king&#39;s carriage to the forest. The king leaned out of the window and asked the forester whose forest that was.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">“It belongs to the Marquis of Carabas,” said the ranger.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: left;">“Well, well, well,” said the king, nodding kindly to the miller&#39;s son. “Well, well, well.”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The princess smiled and moved a little closer to the boy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Meanwhile the cat kept running and now he came to the magician&#39;s castle. It was an enormous castle, twice as big and as beautiful as the king&#39;s. Now that magician was a very nasty man. No one dared to come near his castle, because everyone could</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tell you</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_043.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">that he had once turned a hundred people into worms – just like that, because he was in a bad mood. But Puss in Boots was not afraid of anything, he simply walked in. Clack, clack went the boots on the shiny marble floor, and the magician, who was sitting behind a large table, looked up in surprise.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The cat bowed deeply. &#39;Oh, great magician,&#39; he said, &#39;everyone says that you are a very good magician, but then people say so much.&#39; &#39;So you don&#39;t believe that?&#39; said the magician. &#39;Well, just watch!&#39; Hardly had he said this when he had disappeared, and in the magician&#39;s place stood a great roaring lion, who tried to crush the cat with his claws. But the cat had expected something like that and quickly ran away, into the curtains.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;Wonderful, wonderful!&#39; cried the cat from above. &#39;You really can do wonderful magic. But can you also change yourself into something small? A little mouse, for instance?&#39;</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At the same</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">moment the lion had disappeared and a little mouse was scurrying about the floor, squeaking.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">“Now I have you,” said the cat, and in one bound he was down and ate the little mouse, skin and all.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The royal carriage had now arrived at the castle. The king leaned out of the window to see who he could ask whose this beautiful castle was. To his surprise, Puss in</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Boots came out.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">&quot;Your Royal Highness,&quot; said the cat, bowing deeply, &quot;welcome to the castle of the Marquis of Carabas.&quot; &quot;Well, well, well, well,&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">said the king, looking admiringly at the miller&#39;s son.</p><p class="s25" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">&quot;Well, well, well, well,&quot; said the princess, and held out her hand to the miller&#39;s</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">son, who helped her out of the carriage. They all walked into the castle. Everyone&#39;s eyes widened – and the miller&#39;s son in particular! What splendor and magnificence: marble and gold everywhere!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;Your castle is even more beautiful and larger than mine,&#39; said the king to the miller&#39;s son. &#39;I have been looking for a husband for my daughter for a long time,&#39; he continued, &#39;and I think you are very suitable for it.&#39;</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The princess nodded three or four times in succession, because she thought so too.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 114%;text-align: left;">Soon the wedding was celebrated and the bride and groom went to live in the beautiful castle.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">And the cat? He got his own room and twenty footmen, who did nothing but look after him all day. He also got a cupboard full of boots, in every colour of the rainbow.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">Everything was now rosy, except that the princess could never understand why her husband spoiled that cat so much. Twenty footmen, she thought that was really excessive!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But he couldn&#39;t explain that to her. <span><img width="19" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_044.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="241" height="37" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_045.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The three wishes</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">E</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">R ONCE WAS a poor woodcutter, who lived with his wife in a very</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark13">small dilapidated hut. No matter how hard he worked and how much wood he chopped, it was no use. They remained just as poor.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">In front of their house they had a small vegetable garden, so they always had vegetables. And sometimes, when the man earned a little extra, the woman would buy a nice piece of fatty bacon. One morning the man went out into the forest again before dawn with his axe to chop wood. In his bag he had some carrots from the vegetable garden, that was his lunch. When he was walking home again late in the afternoon, he suddenly heard a little voice halfway, very softly, as if it was coming from very</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">far away. That was strange, because no one ever came to this part of the forest. The man thought for a moment that he had imagined it, but no, now he heard it again, a weak cry: &#39;Help! Help!&#39; The man looked around. No one to be seen. He was about</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to walk on</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">when he saw something moving under a blown-off branch. It was a very small man who was waving his arms wildly. &#39;Help! Help!&#39; &#39;I&#39;m coming,&#39; said the woodcutter and he quickly removed the branch.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The little man jumped up and dusted off his clothes. &#39;I was looking for mushrooms,&#39; he said, &#39;and then the wind started blowing and this branch hit me on the head. You have</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">saved my life! As a reward, you can make three wishes. And I will grant them all.&#39; &#39;Three wishes?&#39; the man asked in disbelief.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">&#39;Can you do that, grant wishes?&#39; &#39;Yes, of course,&#39; the little man replied, &#39;but I warn you: think carefully before you wish for anything, because wishing is harder than you think!&#39; &#39;May I wish for whatever I want?&#39; asked the woodcutter, still</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">incredulous. &#39;I don&#39;t care what?&#39; &#39;Anything that comes into your head,&#39; said the little man. He greeted the woodcutter and</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">disappeared among the ferns.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_046.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;Why is it so hard to make a wish?&#39; the man said to himself. &#39;I can think of a hundred wishes in a row: a roast chicken, a delicious foam pudding, a lovely warm</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">doughnut with lots of powdered sugar, pea soup with a pig&#39;s trotter... Mmmm,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">my mouth is watering already.&#39; He ran home and called from far away: &#39;Woman, woman, just listen to what I&#39;ve been through!&#39; His wife was in the kitchen preparing the meager evening meal. &#39;What then?&#39; she asked.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I have three wishes,” said the man, breathlessly, “and they will all come true at once!”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Stumbling over his words, the woodcutter told him all about the little man. &#39;And now I may wish for whatever I wish. Anything is allowed.&#39; &#39;He must have been joking,&#39; said the woman, as she spooned some potatoes and a boiled onion onto his plate.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The man, who had been dreaming about puddings and doughnuts all the way</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">home, looked regretfully at those potatoes and onions. &#39;I wish there was a nice big fat sausage with it,&#39; he said, and hardly had he finished speaking when there was the sausage steaming on his plate, sitting cosily next to the potatoes and</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">onions!</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">“Look, woman, there lies a real sausage!” exclaimed the woodcutter in amazement. &quot;That little man wasn&#39;t joking at all!&quot; &quot;You idiot!&quot; said</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">his wife. &quot;Look what you&#39;ve done! Instead of nice clothes or a lot of money, you&#39;re wishing for something as stupid as a sausage!&quot; &quot;I said it without thinking,&quot; said the man, startled.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;ve never seen anything so stupid!&quot; the woman wailed. &quot;Stupid as stupid! A sausage!&quot; &quot;I do love sausage...&quot; the</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">man stammered.</p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;What&#39;s that got to do with it!&#39; the woman roared. &#39;A golden axe for you, diamond earrings for me, a nice house or just a lot of money, anything would have been better than a sausage!&#39; &#39;We have two more wishes,&#39;</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">said the man, &#39;so…&#39; &#39;So-so-so,&#39; the woman shouted, &#39;you</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">and your so! You really messed up the first wish! I&#39;ve never seen such a fool!&#39; And so she went on swearing.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Stop that yelling!&quot; the man shouted. &quot;What are you doing to yourself about a sausage! I wish that stupid sausage was hanging from your stupid nose!&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And there hung the sausage from the woman&#39;s nose... For a moment, the room was deathly quiet. Then the woman started pulling hard on the sausage, but it wouldn&#39;t let go. The man grabbed a knife and tried to cut the sausage off her nose, but that didn&#39;t work either. They looked at each other in defeat. The woman started to cry. There they were, and now what? The man put his arm around her shoulders.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">&quot;Now I&#39;ll have to walk around with that sausage on my nose all my life,&quot; she sobbed. &quot;Everyone will laugh at me!&quot; Then</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">the man stood in the middle of the room and shouted loudly and clearly, &quot;I have a third wish, and I wish that the sausage will fall off your nose!&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And that happened. Relieved, they threw their arms around each other and then they danced around the room. They sat down at the table again, divided the sausage neatly in two and ate their plates empty with relish. And then they went to bed, very satisfied, because nobody wants to walk around with a sausage on their nose all their lives.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But yes, they were still just as poor… <span><img width="19" height="19" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_047.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_048.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s26" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 156pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Sleeping Beauty</p><h2 style="padding-top: 16pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 22pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there once lived a king and a queen who had a little girl. They were very happy about it. The flags went up and</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">they had a big party. They knew thirteen fairies and they wanted to invite</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark14">them all, but the annoying thing was that they only had twelve golden plates. Well, they thought, then we&#39;ll only invite twelve. The thirteenth fairy won&#39;t mind that. Well, they thought wrong. The thirteenth fairy felt very insulted. She was furious,</a></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and she wasn&#39;t entirely wrong, let&#39;s face it!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">When the party was in full swing, one by one the fairies made a wish they had made for the child.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The first came forward and said, &#39;The little princess will be very beautiful.&#39; The second came forward and said, &#39;The little princess will be very sweet.&#39; The next fairy said, &#39;The little princess will be very happy.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">This went on until eleven fairies had wished the little princess something beautiful. Just as the twelfth fairy was about to come forward, she was pushed aside.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And do you know by whom? By the evil thirteenth fairy, who wasn&#39;t invited.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">She suddenly appeared in the party room. No one had seen her enter and she was furious!</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">&quot;Now my wish!&quot; she shouted. &quot;And I say: when she is fifteen, the little princess will prick herself on a spinning wheel! And she will drop dead right there, next to the spinning wheel!&quot; And off she went again.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Everyone stood there, stunned with fear. Fortunately, the twelfth fairy had not yet made her wish. &#39;I cannot undo the thirteenth fairy&#39;s wish entirely,&#39; she</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">said, &#39;but I can make it less bad. The little princess will prick herself on a spinning wheel, unfortunately I cannot change that. But she will not drop dead, no, she will fall asleep and she will remain asleep for a hundred years.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_049.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">A hundred years of sleep! The king and queen were very sad, you can understand that. A hundred years is a very long time, you know! But yes, it is still less bad than dropping dead.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The king and queen could think of nothing else. &#39;Do you know what?&#39; said the king. &#39;Everyone in the land must burn their spinning wheel.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">If there are no more spinning wheels, the princess cannot prick herself on them</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">either.&#39; No sooner said than done. The next day there was not a single spinning wheel to be found in the whole country. The little princess grew up and all the wishes of the twelve fairies came true. She became a beautiful and sweet girl who would not hurt a fly, and everyone really loved her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">When she turned fifteen, the parents remembered what the thirteenth fairy had said. All the spinning wheels had been burned, so the princess was not really in danger, but the parents were still cautious. They decided not to have a birthday party, because you never know with so many guests.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">But the little princess did get a day off. She didn&#39;t have to attend classes that day and she didn&#39;t have to do any homework.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The girl was a little bored. She wandered through the palace gardens and through the palace corridors. She looked into rooms she had never been in before – the palace was so big! As she strolled, she came to the royal attic. There she saw a small door that stood ajar. She pushed it open and came into a small room. At the window sat an old woman, and next to her stood something the little princess had never seen before.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She pointed at it curiously. &#39;My dear lady, what is that thing?&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The old woman looked up from her work. &#39;Dear princess, this is a spinning wheel,&#39; she said gently. &#39;Come closer, you may touch it.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">And hardly had the little princess touched the spinning-wheel, when she pricked herself on something. And as the twelfth fairy had predicted, she sank to the ground and fell into a hundred-year sleep.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_050.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Hahaha!” laughed the old woman, because – you guessed it – she</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">was of course the thirteenth fairy who had changed into a sweet old woman!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The strange thing was that not only the princess fell asleep, but everyone in the palace. The cook was just about to give his assistant a box on the ear and remained asleep with his hand in the air. A lady-in-waiting was just about to hang a dress in a closet and now also slept, with the dress in her hands. And even the dogs and the chickens fell asleep.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The gardener was just pruning a rose bush when he fell asleep.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">So that bush grew and grew. It grew up against the walls of the palace. It grew all over it and after a few months there was nothing left of the palace.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Many years later, only a few old people could still tell that under that enormous rose bush there was a palace with a sleeping princess in it.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The people only half believed it, but they did give her a name: Princess Sleeping Beauty. There were many princes who tried to cut down the bush to find the princess, but all the branches that were cut off grew back immediately. There was no starting.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">When those hundred years were finally over, a prince on his white horse happened to be riding through this region. He saw the rosebush, which was now as high as a mountain. &#39;I have never seen anything like it,&#39; he said to his horse, for he was his best friend. &#39;Let us go and see if those old stories are true. Is it really true that a beautiful princess is sleeping under all those roses?&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">He got off his horse, drew his sword and raised his arm to start chopping. But he didn&#39;t even have to. The branches parted of their own accord to let him through. To his astonishment, the prince saw a beautiful palace. He saw the sleeping gardener, the sleeping lady-in-waiting, he saw beautiful halls and didn&#39;t understand anything. When he got to the attic and opened the little door, he saw a spinning wheel and next to it a sleeping girl lay on the wooden</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">floor.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">This must be the little princess, thought the prince. He bent over her. So she really existed and yes, she really was as beautiful as everyone said. He could</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">he couldn&#39;t help it, he kissed her and then… Then Sleeping Beauty slowly opened her eyes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: -1pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">You can imagine. Not long after, they got married. The little princess went to bed very late every night and got up before dawn the next morning.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Because she had already done enough sleeping. <span><img width="15" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_051.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="234" height="45" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_052.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s28" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Table, set your tables!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">E</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">R ONCE UPON A TIME – oh, a long time ago – there was a poor tailor who, besides three sons, had only a goat. He had nothing else.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And he was kinder to that goat than to his sons. Listen.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Every day, one of the three boys had to take the goat to the pasture. When it was the oldest boy&#39;s turn again, he took the animal to a spot where the tastiest grass grew.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">At the end of the day, he asked: &#39;Have you eaten enough?&#39; &#39;I can&#39;t swallow another blade of grass,&#39; the goat</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark15">replied. When the son came home, the first thing the father asked was: &#39;Have you</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">fed the goat properly?&#39; &#39;Yes,&#39; said the boy, &#39;she can&#39;t swallow another blade of grass.&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I told you</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">that the father was so fond of his goat, didn&#39;t I? Well, he went straight to the stable and asked the goat: &#39;Have you eaten enough today?&#39; &#39;Pfff, eaten enough?&#39; was the answer. &#39;My stomach is still growling from hunger.&#39; The father became very</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">angry. &#39;Liar!&#39; he shouted at his son and chased him out of the house without mercy. Imagine,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">he believed his goat before his son!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The next day the second son had to take the goat to the pasture. He took</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">her to a place with the tastiest clover. At the end of the day he asked the goat: &#39;Did you eat well?&#39; &#39;I can&#39;t swallow another leaf,&#39;</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">said the goat. Once home, his father asked: &#39;Well? Did the goat eat well?&#39; &#39;Yes,&#39; said the son, &#39;she couldn&#39;t swallow another leaf.&#39; The</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">father went to the stable and again the goat said she was still hungry.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The father became very angry again, grabbed a stick and chased the second son out of the door. The next day the same thing happened to the third</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">son, and he was also thrown out into the street.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_053.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Well, now the father had to take the goat to the pasture himself. At the end of the day he asked her if she had eaten enough. &#39;I can&#39;t swallow another bite,&#39; said the goat. &#39;Good,&#39; said the father, &#39;then we can go home.&#39; And back in the stable he said to the goat with satisfaction: &#39;I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve at least eaten well today.&#39; &#39;Pfff, did you eat well?&#39; said the goat. &#39;My stomach is still</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">growling with hunger.&#39; &#39;You mean liar,&#39; he shouted, &#39;I&#39;ll teach you!&#39; He grabbed her, shaved her head and chased her out the door.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And there the father was, all alone. He was sorry for what he had done to his sons and wanted them to come home, but he didn’t know where they were…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Well, I&#39;ll tell you. The eldest son had gone to work for a cabinetmaker. But after a year he missed his family and wanted to go home very much. The cabinetmaker gave him a little table as a parting gift - not an ordinary table, but a wonderful table. When you said: &#39;Table, set yourself!&#39;, the most delicious dishes appeared on the table top</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and you could eat your fill</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">to eat.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The boy thanked the cabinetmaker, took the table on his back and started the long journey home. On the way he wanted to know if it really was such a special table.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">He put it on the grass and said: &#39;Table, set yourself!&#39; And yes, hardly had he said that when on the table stood a plate of roasted chicken legs and a large glass of fresh orange juice. When evening fell he went into an inn. It was full of people and soon</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">it became very cozy. &#39;Shall I show you something?&#39; asked the boy after a few glasses of wine.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">He placed the table in the middle of the dining room and said, &quot;Table, set!&quot; Well, you can imagine that everyone fell off their chairs in amazement when the most</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">delicious food appeared.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The innkeeper saw it all happen and thought: I must have that table!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">At midnight the eldest son went to his room. He put the little table in a corner and fell asleep like a log.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">A moment later the door opened softly. The innkeeper crept in. He had a little table with him that looked exactly like the miracle table and</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_054.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">he quietly exchanged them.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The next day the boy took the table on his back and set off again. When he came home that evening, the father was so happy to have at least one son back that he invited the whole neighborhood for dinner. &quot;And what have you got there?&quot; everyone asked curiously.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Just wait,&quot; said the eldest son. He had all the neighbors stand in a circle</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">around the table, spread out his arms and said solemnly: &quot;Table, set yourself!&quot; But of course nothing happened. Everyone laughed at him. The eldest son</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">scratched his head. He did not understand anything.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The second son had ended up with a miller. And he too wanted to return home after a year. His boss gave him a donkey as a farewell gift – a very special one, because if you said &#39;Donkey, stretch yourself!&#39;, five coins came out of its ass</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">or mouth.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He took the donkey along on a rope, and as soon as he could no longer see the mill, he stopped and said: &#39;Donkey, stretch yourself!&#39; And yes, a moment later he walked on contentedly with five coins in his</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">pocket. In the evening he ended up in the same inn where his brother had slept. He took the donkey to the stable, asked for the best room and ordered an extensive meal. &#39;How much should I pay?&#39; asked the boy when he had finished eating.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This boy must be rich, thought the innkeeper, because he wants the best</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">room, right? I&#39;ll just ask for three coins more than usual. &#39;Nine coins,&#39; he said without hesitation. The boy only had five coins in his pocket, but that was of course</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">no problem. &#39;That&#39;s fine,&#39; he said, &#39;I&#39;ll be right back!&#39; The innkeeper secretly followed him to the stable and peered</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">through a crack in the wooden door. When he heard what the boy said to the donkey and saw the coins coming out of the donkey, he thought to himself: I want a donkey like that too! And while the boy was snoring in his posh room later that evening, the innkeeper quietly exchanged the wonder donkey for a regular donkey.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The next day the boy took the animal by the rope and continued on his way. When he knocked on his father&#39;s door that evening, he was very glad that</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_055.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">he now had his second son back. &#39;So, have you brought a donkey?&#39; he said. Again all the neighbours came round and the second son had them stand in a circle round the donkey. &#39;Donkey, stretch yourself!&#39; he called solemnly.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But again nothing happened and he too was laughed at by everyone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Oh, what a coincidence,&quot; said the eldest brother, &quot;that happened to me too.&quot; It soon turned</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 157%;text-align: left;">out that they had slept in the same inn, and they understood that the innkeeper had exchanged the miracle table and the miracle donkey. What a wicked cheat! They decided to go to the inn to get the table and the donkey back, but they did not yet know how to go about it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And what had happened to the youngest son in the meantime? He had gone to work for a woodcarver, and after a year he too wanted to return to his father. As a parting gift he was given a jute bag.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;Look, this is a special bag,&#39; said the woodcarver. &#39;There is a wooden club in it. If</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">you are robbed by a thief, just shout, &quot;Club, <i><b>out of </b></i>the bag!&quot; and the club will beat the thief until you say, &quot;Club, <i><b>in </b></i>the bag!&quot;&#39; The youngest son said goodbye to his master and set off for home.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">When it was getting dark, he met his brothers near the inn. They told him what had happened and the three brothers came up with a plan.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The eldest and the middle brother looked for a place to sleep under a tree, not far from the inn. The youngest went into the inn.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;I want a room that can be locked,&quot; he said to the innkeeper, &quot;because I have a bag here that is worth gold.&quot; The innkeeper</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">immediately thought: I must have a bag that is worth gold...</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And at night, when everyone was asleep and the inn was deathly quiet, the innkeeper quietly climbed through a little window into the youngest son&#39;s room.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Just as he was about to run off with the bag, the youngest son shouted, &quot;Club, out of the bag!&quot; The club flew out of the bag and gave the innkeeper a merciless beating. The innkeeper shouted, but the boy was not impressed. &quot;If you don&#39;t give</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">back my brothers&#39; table and donkey soon,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#39;ll have you beaten to death.&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;Ouch, ow,&#39; groaned the innkeeper, &#39;yes, yes, I&#39;ll give them back, ow, ow!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Put a club in the sack!&quot; said the boy, and so the brothers got their table and their donkey back, and the three of them set out for home.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Of course, that was a party! The whole neighborhood was there again and this time no one laughed at them when the oldest son shouted &#39;Table, set yourself!&#39; and the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">second son &#39;Donkey, stretch yourself!&#39;. On the contrary! Everyone enjoyed the delicious food and it was a real party when they all got a few coins.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Then everyone looked at the youngest son, but he quickly said: &#39;I didn&#39;t bring anything!&#39; Because of course he didn&#39;t want the club to come out of the bag.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And the goat? That mean liar? She was so ashamed of her shaved head that</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">she hid in a fox&#39;s den. When the fox came home in the evening and saw the goat&#39;s two shining eyes in the dark, he was terrified and fled into the forest. There he met a</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">bear. Together they went back to the den. But the bear was also frightened and fled.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fox and the bear called for a bee and it stung the goat in her bald head. The</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">goat jumped out of the den with a scream and ran like crazy into the forest. Nobody knows what became of that goat. Maybe she is still running. Who knows...</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 255pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="18" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_056.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="156" height="45" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_057.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s29" style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 30pt;text-align: left;">Rapunzel</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 19pt;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there was a man and a woman who were very were happy, because the woman was expecting a baby! She often sat</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">before the attic window and then looked down into her neighbor&#39;s garden, which was</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 157%;text-align: left;">full of the most beautiful flowers and where even vegetables and herbs grew. She would have liked to walk into that garden and smell all those flowers, but that was not possible, because the garden belonged to a mean, wicked witch. Everyone was afraid of her - people said she could do magic!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark16">One day the woman was sitting in front of the attic window knitting a baby jacket. In the witch&#39;s vegetable garden she saw rows of cucumbers, carrots, green</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">beans and rapunzel, a kind of lettuce. Suddenly she had a terrible craving for that rapunzel. She called her husband and said that she would die if she didn&#39;t get a plate of rapunzel soon.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;But that Rapunzel belongs to that mean witch!&quot; said the man, shocked.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;I don&#39;t care,&quot; said the woman, and she began to cry. &quot;If I don&#39;t get a plate of Rapunzel soon, I&#39;ll die.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, that man didn&#39;t want that, of course. So there was nothing else to do: he had</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">to try to get into that garden. The man waited until it was dark and then quietly, without making a sound, climbed over the high wall and walked on tiptoes to the vegetable garden.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">He was just about to put a handful of rapunzel in his pocket, when suddenly the witch stood in front of him! That was a fright!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Hey!&quot; she hissed angrily. &quot;What are you doing with my Rapunzel?&quot; &quot;My wife is expecting a child,&quot; the man stammered, &quot;and she&#39;s so hungry for Rapunzel that she might die if she doesn&#39;t get it.&quot; The witch rubbed her long</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">chin, narrowed her eyes and said, &quot;Well, well, there&#39;s going to be a child. Yes, yes. And without Rapunzel, your wife might die.&quot; She was silent for a moment and then continued, &quot;Well, okay. You can have my Rapunzel, but when the child is born, it&#39;s mine.&quot; The man</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_058.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">was so scared – imagine if she turned him into a spider or something! – that all he did was nod and run away with a bag full of rapunzel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 157%;text-align: left;">And sure enough, on the day the child was born, the witch suddenly appeared in the middle of the room, snatched the baby from the cradle, and disappeared before the parents could do anything. It was a girl, and the witch named her Rapunzel. She took her to a hut deep in the woods and never showed up again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Rapunzel grew up and became a very beautiful girl. The witch, who was almost bald herself, was very proud of Rapunzel&#39;s beautiful hair. She thought it was a shame to cut it off. And because of that Rapunzel walked around with braids that were ten times as long as her own.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">When Rapunzel was twelve, the witch locked her up in a high tower, not far from the hut. Why she did that, no one knows, and it was also a special tower, because it had no door. There was only a window, high up, just under the roof. So no one could get to the girl. But how did she get food, you wonder? Well, the witch brought it. Twice a</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">day she stood at the bottom of the tower with a basket of food and called out:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Rapunzel, Rapunzel, dear child, throw your hair quickly!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Then Rapunzel wound her long braids around a hook next to the window and let them fall out of the window, and the witch then climbed up the braids.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One day a prince was riding his horse through the forest. He had been wandering</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">around for days, when suddenly he heard a girl singing. It was strange, right in the middle of the dense forest! He rode towards the song and there he saw a tower through the trees and Rapunzel standing in front of the window. What a beautiful girl, the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">prince thought to himself.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">At that moment an old woman came running. She had a big basket with her, stood at the bottom of the tower and called up:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_059.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Rapunzel, Rapunzel, dear child, throw your hair quickly!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Two golden blond braids fell down and he saw the woman climb up them. After a while the witch climbed down the braids again and disappeared between the trees. The</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">prince appeared from behind the bushes. The girl was no longer standing at the window, so he called out:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Rapunzel, Rapunzel, dear child, throw your hair quickly!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And yes, there came the braids! The prince climbed up. Rapunzel was of course very surprised when not the witch, but a complete stranger stepped in through the window. He was a very handsome prince, so no wonder she fell in love with him immediately. And he with her too, by the way.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">They talked a little, and he promised to come back the next day. And he did so – not only the next day, but every day after that, and only when it was dark, because the witch could come during the day.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">One day, when the witch was with her again, Rapunzel made a slip of the tongue. &quot;You are much heavier than the prince who comes here every night,&quot; she said by mistake. Oops, it was out before she knew it!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 133%;text-align: left;">The witch was speechless at first, and then she became very angry. Without saying a word, she grabbed a big knife and – zip – cut off Rapunzel’s braids! She tied them to the hook next to the window, forced Rapunzel to climb out, and climbed down after her. The witch pushed Rapunzel ahead of her, deep into the forest. In a lonely dark place,</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">the witch left Rapunzel alone, in the middle of the forest, without food and without water.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The witch quickly returned to the tower. She climbed up the braids, brought them</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">inside, and stood in the middle of the room, gritting her teeth. With her hands on her hips, she hissed, &quot;There, prince, come on.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then you&#39;ll be in for a treat!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When evening came she heard him calling:</p><p class="s30" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">Rapunzel, Rapunzel, dear child, throw your hair quickly!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The witch threw down the braids and the prince climbed up</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">unsuspectingly. When he wanted to step inside, the witch gave him a good blow on the head and pushed him out of the window. He landed in a bramble bush below, fell with his eyes in the thorns and then he was blind. The story becomes sadder and sadder…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">The prince wandered about in the great forest, and somewhere else in that same forest Rapunzel wandered about. They ate berries and drank from forest streams. And so it went on for years.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 157%;text-align: left;">But then it becomes happier again, because one day they met each other by chance. He heard a girl singing and immediately recognized Rapunzel&#39;s voice. Rapunzel had to cry terribly</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 157%;text-align: left;">when she saw that the prince was blind. Her tears fell on his eyes and... suddenly he could see again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_060.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 274%;text-align: left;">Together they went to his castle, there they got married and they lived happily ever after. They deserved it, after so much misery!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_061.jpg"/></span></p><h4 style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The silver coin</h4><h2 style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 22pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there was a soldier who came back from a war. At home he was told that his father was dead. His</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">brothers had divided everything the father owned between them. So there was</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">nothing left for the soldier. The eldest brother thought that was a shame and gave</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">him a silver coin as a consolation. One silver coin, that was all he got. The soldier put the silver coin in his pocket. Because he now had no home either, he went out into the wide world.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">One evening he came to a large forest. An old thin man in torn clothes asked him if he had any money for him, because he was very hungry.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark17">The soldier thought: No way! I only have that silver coin, and I want to buy bread with it. But he saw how the old man stood trembling with hunger. So he took out the coin and said: &#39;Please, I am young and strong, I can go without food for another day.&#39; At that moment the old man changed into a young prince. Instead</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of rags he now had on a beautiful suit, which glittered with pearls and precious stones.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">&#39;I am the magician of this forest,&#39; he said, &#39;and because you wanted to give me your coin, I will reward you for your goodness. You may make a wish, and I will grant it. Just tell me what you want!&#39; The</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">boy thought for a moment, and then said, &#39;I have always wanted to know what it is like to be an animal. I wish that I could change into a hare or a bird or a fish.&#39; &#39;That is a beautiful</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">wish,&#39; said the magician, &#39;and your wish has already been granted.&#39; And in the same instant he had disappeared, just like that, into nothingness.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Could I really change into a hare? thought the boy. And sure enough: there he was, a hare. And so he was a fish for a moment, and a little later a bird!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_062.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Satisfied, the boy walked on and soon he came to a village. The king was visiting, looking for soldiers, because he wanted to wage war against another country. &#39;Don&#39;t you want to become a soldier in my army?&#39; he asked the boy.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The boy wanted to do that, because he had been a soldier and at least then he would earn some money.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Then came the day that the king called all the soldiers together. It was time to start the war. The next morning they left before dawn.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Now you must know that the king had nothing to fear. He had a very special ring, which made him win all the wars. So when they saw the enemy in the distance after three days, the king was not at all worried.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">In ten straight rows the enemy stood, ready for battle. The king was about to give the signal to attack, when he discovered that he did not have his ring with him. It was at home on the nightstand!</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">To fetch the ring, that was three days there and three days back; that would take six days. Four perhaps, if someone was very quick. That would take too long. What if the enemy attacked soon? The king did not know what to do and cried out in despair: &#39;Whoever can fetch the ring for me and be back before evening may marry my daughter!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Our soldier stepped forward and said he would try. He left the camp, hid behind a rock, quickly changed into a hare and jumped away. But someone had seen what had happened: an older soldier, who was jealous of him, because the boy belonged to the royal guard and he did not.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The boy ran like a hare over hills and through valleys. When he came to a river, he changed into a fish and shot through the water like an arrow from a bow. At a mountain he changed into a bird and so he flew into the princess&#39;s room a little later. There he changed back into himself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The princess was a little shocked when she suddenly saw a strange young man standing in her room, but he quickly explained to her why he had come and she</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_063.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">understood that there was no time to lose. She hurried to her father&#39;s bedside table.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">When she gave him the ring, they looked deeply into each other&#39;s eyes, and they both instantly fell deeply in love.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Then the boy did something very clever, which would serve him well later. &#39;Pay attention,&#39; he said, &#39;and do exactly as I ask you.&#39; And he turned into a hare.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Cut a piece out of my tail,” he said.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then he quickly turned into a fish. &#39;Pull two scales from my back,&#39; he said.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">And finally he changed into a bird. &#39;Pluck two feathers from my wing,&#39; he said, &#39;and keep all these things safe.&#39; And away he flew, out of the window, back to the king.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">On his way he changed back into a fish, and finally arrived at the camp as a hare, with the ring clenched between his teeth. The jealous soldier saw the hare coming, grabbed his gun and… shot!</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The creature toppled over. Dead as a doornail. The jealous soldier quickly</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">grabbed the ring from its mouth and gave it to the king. He put the ring on his finger and you guessed it: he won the war.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Back at the palace, the king went with the jealous soldier to his daughter. &#39;Thanks to this good soldier, we have won the war,&#39; he told her. &#39;So he may marry you. I promised him that.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The day after tomorrow is the</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">wedding.&#39; The princess began to cry. She said that the man was a liar, but the king did not believe her. The princess continued to cry, even on the day of the wedding, and well... a crying bride, that was of course not possible, so the party was postponed for a day.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Meanwhile the wizard of the forest looked into his magic ball and saw the hare lying dead in the field. He rubbed the ball, made a few magic gestures</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">and said: &#39;Come to life again, hare! Get up and go quickly to your princess, for she is to marry someone else tomorrow.&#39; The hare blinked</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">his eyes, jumped up and ran to the palace.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the way he first turned back into a fish and then into a bird, until</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">he eventually stood before the king as a soldier.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;I have come to get my reward,&quot; he said. &quot;I have fetched the ring for you, and so I may marry your daughter. You yourself said so.&quot; &quot;That is not true,&quot; said</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the king. &quot;I got the ring from another soldier, not from you.&quot; But he was not</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">entirely sure, so he called his daughter. She immediately threw her arms around the soldier&#39;s neck.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Father,&quot; she cried happily, &quot;this is the soldier who fetched the ring! Not the other one.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The other one is a deceiver.&quot; &quot;Who am I</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">to believe?&quot; said the king, completely confused. The princess ran to her room and came back with a golden box. She took out the tuft of hare&#39;s tail. The soldier changed himself into a hare. Now the king could see that the tuft of tail fitted exactly into the bald part of the hare&#39;s tail.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Then the princess pulled out the two scales. The soldier turned into a fish. The king himself could see that two scales were missing from the back.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Finally, the king saw with his own eyes that the bird was missing two feathers in its wings. And those two feathers the princess had in her hand…</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The impostor was given a hundred lashes, kicked out of the palace and never allowed to show his face again.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The soldier married his princess. After a few years the king died and the soldier became king.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Sometimes, when he wanted to see how things were going in his kingdom, he would fly over his land as a dove, or look out of the water as a fish, or hide himself as a hare among the bushes. In this way he came to know all sorts of things, and he could take good care of his people.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He became the best king the country ever had. <span><img width="19" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_064.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="371" height="45" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_065.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s31" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The fisherman and his wife</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">E</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">R ONCE UPON A TIME – long, long ago – there was a fisherman who was so poor that he</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">lived with his wife in an upturned flower pot. The fisherman found that&#39;s not so bad, that&#39;s just how it was, and actually it was quite pleasant.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Every morning he would walk to the sea very early and only in the afternoon would he come home with the fish he had caught. He never experienced anything special, until one day…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">That day he caught a fish that could talk. &#39;If you throw me back into the sea, I will reward you,&#39; said the fish. &#39;You may then make a wish, and I will grant it.&#39; The man</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">was, as he</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark18">had said, a contented man, so he said: &#39;Oh, flounder&#39; - for that was what he had caught: a flounder, which is a kind of fish - &#39;flounder, what should I wish for? I have a wife, I have food every day, and I have a roof over my head. I need no more.&#39; And with these words he threw the flounder back into the sea. The fish disappeared under water and the fisherman went home. In the evening, when he and his wife were in bed, the man told them about the fish.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">&quot;Were you really allowed to make a wish?&quot; asked the woman. &quot;And what did you wish for?&quot; &quot;Nothing,&quot; said the man. &quot;We don&#39;t have anything to wish for, do we?&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">That night the woman thought it over, and the next morning she said, &quot;I do have something to wish for.&quot; &quot;Oh,&quot; said the man, surprised,</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">&quot;what is it?&quot; &quot;I should like to live in a real</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">house like everyone else,&quot; said the woman, &quot;instead of an upturned flower pot.&quot; &quot;Do you mean I should ask the bot for a house?&quot; asked the man.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">&quot;Yes,&quot; said the woman, &quot;a simple little house with walls, windows, a roof and a chimney.

And sure enough, instead of the upturned flowerpot, there stood a real little house with straight walls, a roof,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">a chimney and windows with cheerful curtains. And everything was neatly painted. His wife came to meet him with outstretched arms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;Isn&#39;t it a beautiful little house?&#39; she cried excitedly. &#39;And look how cosy it is inside. This is quite different from an upturned flowerpot.&#39; The man had to admit that. It had been pitch dark inside the flowerpot all day, and now light streamed in</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">through the three windows.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">There was room for a table and two chairs and – what a surprise! – there was an extra room for sleeping.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The woman was overjoyed. She kept the house clean by singing. But after a few weeks she said to her husband in bed at night: &#39;This house is quite cozy and nice, but very cramped. We could use some more space. If you ask the bot tomorrow for a bigger house...&#39; &#39;But I was only allowed one wish,&#39; said the man.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Oh, one wish more or less,&quot; said the woman, &quot;what does that matter? After all, he owes his life to you.&quot; His wife may have been right about that, so when he stood by the sea again the next morning he cried out:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Flounder, flounder in</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the sea, here&#39;s little man Timpetee.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_067.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: left;">My dearest wife Elsebil, wants something that I don&#39;t want.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The man waited tensely.

It had not three but ten large high windows and a wide terrace. His wife was waiting for him, beaming: &#39;Well, what do you think? Quite different from that tiny little hut, don&#39;t you think?&#39; And that was true. The living room was ten times as big. &#39;See!&#39; said the wife. &#39;Aren&#39;t you glad you asked for it?&#39; &#39;Yes, that was a good idea,&#39; said the husband, &#39;and are you happy now?&#39; &#39;Yes, what did you think!&#39; said the wife, proudly showing</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">him five large bedrooms.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">But after two weeks the woman said: &#39;This house is beautiful and big, but it all has to be kept clean, and that is no fun.&#39; &#39;What do you want then?&#39; asked the man, shocked.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">&quot;A couple of maids, for instance, to help me,&quot; said the woman, &quot;and then ask the bot for a cook and someone to do the laundry, and someone else to tend the garden.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">The next day there was a strong wind, the waves splashed high against the rocks. The fisherman stood by the sea and shouted into the wind:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Flounder, flounder in</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the sea, here&#39;s little man Timpetee.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: left;">My dearest wife Elsebil, wants something that I don&#39;t want.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Well, what does she want?” asked the bot, who immediately came up.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">&quot;Well,&quot; said the man, &quot;the house is really spacious, and we are very happy with it, but it also means a lot of work. She thought that if she had some help</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_068.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">had…&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;Go home,&#39; said the bot, &#39;she has help already.&#39; His wife</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">stood at the front door. She clapped her hands twice and twelve servants came out and stood in a neat row.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;Look,&#39; said the woman, &#39;they do all the work now.&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;Well, well,&#39; said the man, &#39;did you ever think that one day you would have twelve servants? Now you must be content.&#39; &#39;Who wouldn&#39;t be?&#39; said</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">the woman. She folded her hands on her chest and watched with satisfaction as the servants went to work.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It was quiet for a few days, but then the woman started to whine again. &#39;I like it,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">being the boss of people, but it&#39;s a shame there are only twelve. I&#39;d like to be the boss of many more people.&#39; And after another day of thinking she said: &#39;Man, I want to</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">be queen!</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Then I&#39;ll be the boss of a lot of people. And I want a palace. Ask the bot tomorrow.&#39; The man protested fiercely,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">but the woman said angrily that she would be very unhappy if she didn&#39;t become queen. So, well, what do you do then?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The wind was blowing hard the next morning. The trees were swaying, the waves were whitecapped. The man had to shout to make himself heard:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Flounder, flounder in</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the sea, here&#39;s little man Timpetee.</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">My dearest wife Elsebil,</p><p class="s5" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">wants something that I don&#39;t want.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There was the flounder again. &#39;Well,&#39; he said, &#39;what does she</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">want?&#39; &#39;She wants to be a queen,&#39; said the man with his head bowed, &#39;and she wants a palace…&#39;</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;Go home,&#39; said the flounder. &#39;She is already a queen and she has a palace.&#39; And indeed… There stood a great snow-white palace, gleaming in the sun, and inside sat his wife on a throne, in a long dress of red velvet. Around her shoulders she had</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">a long red cloak. On her head she wore a golden crown. Along the walls stood footmen and ladies-in-waiting, who</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_069.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">all waited for what the queen would command. The fisherman walked hesitantly towards his wife.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">&#39;Woman,&#39; he said in awe, &#39;how beautiful you look! Are you really a queen now? Must everyone do what you say? Well, now you must be truly satisfied.&#39; His wife said nothing, she only nodded</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">to a footman. He showed him around the palace. It had so many halls and rooms that the man lost count.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After a few days, when they were lying in the great royal bed at night, the fisherwoman –</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">who was now queen – sat up. &#39;If the flounder can make me queen,&#39; she said, &#39;he can also make me empress, and then I shall be the master of all! Husband, tomorrow you will tell your flounder that I want to be empress.&#39; The man was about to say something, but the woman shook him and shouted: &#39;I am queen and you are only a poor fisherman. So you will do as I say, do you understand?&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">The next day, the man walked to the sea with lead in his shoes. The waves were as high as houses and the wind was howling. The man shouted:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Flounder, flounder in</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the sea, here&#39;s little man Timpetee.</p><p class="s8" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: left;">My dearest wife Elsebil, wants something that I don&#39;t want.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After a very long time the flounder came up. &#39;Well, what does she want this time?&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">&#39;She… she wants to be an empress,&#39; the fisherman said softly. He hoped the flounder didn&#39;t hear him.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">&quot;Go home,&quot; said the flounder. &quot;She is already an empress.&quot; And he disappeared into the wild waves.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Now there was a palace as big as a village! The man had to ask for directions to the throne room, which was now much larger. At the far end sat his wife on a high golden throne, her robe glittering and sparkling with precious stones. The room was filled with kings, counts</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">and dukes, all bowing to her. His wife was now the most powerful in the entire land.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 157%;text-align: justify;">That night, from the emperor&#39;s bed, the woman looked out of the window and saw the moon rise. &#39;Everyone does what I want,&#39; she said to herself, &#39;even the king does what I want. But that moon, he does what he wants.&#39; She shook the fisherman awake. &#39;Man, I want the moon to do what</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: justify;">I want. Get up, right now! Go to that flounder of yours and tell him that I want to be God.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 157%;text-align: left;">&#39;Being God?&#39; the man stammered. &#39;That can&#39;t be possible…?&#39; He didn&#39;t get any further, because his wife had already kicked him out of bed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 157%;text-align: justify;">Black clouds had passed over the moon, a storm was brewing, rain was lashing his face, the sea was churning as if it were being stirred with a giant spoon. The wind almost blew him over. The fisherman whispered:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Flounder, flounder in</p><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the sea, here&#39;s little man Timpetee.</p><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: left;">My dearest wife Elsebil, wants something that I don&#39;t want.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Well?” said the flounder. “What does she</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="19" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_070.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 156%;text-align: left;">want?” “She… she… wants to be God…” whispered the fisherman. &quot;Go home,&quot; said the flounder. &quot;She&#39;s living in a flowerpot again.&quot; Well...</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="237" height="45" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_071.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Frog Prince</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there once lived a little princess. Now it&#39;s all over</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 34pt;line-height: 132%;text-align: left;">fairy tales often tell about beautiful and sweet princesses, but the princess in this story was different. She was beautiful (really everyone thought she was beautiful), but</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">she wasn&#39;t really sweet.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">One day she was playing in the palace garden with her golden ball. She kept throwing it high into the air. She loved that, because it shone and sparkled so beautifully in the sun. And</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">she kept catching it. Until one time it went wrong. The ball rolled into the pond and immediately disappeared under water. It was made of gold, so it was quite heavy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark19">The princess stood there for a few seconds, completely frightened, and then she</a></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: justify;">began to scream and cry at the same time. A frog was sitting in the middle of the pond on a water lily leaf. It was a big, fat frog, and he croaked: &#39;Princess, why are you crying?&#39; &#39;My ball has fallen into the pond,&#39; sobbed the princess.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">&quot;Oh, but I can help you,&quot; said the frog. &quot;What do you want me to do if I fetch the ball for you?&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The princess immediately stopped crying and quickly wiped the tears from her eyes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">&#39;Everything, everything: my prettiest dress, my prettiest earrings, my prettiest shoes, whatever you want.&#39; &#39;No, no,&#39; said</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">the frog, &#39;that&#39;s no use to me. No, no, what I want is to be your friend, that you take me to</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the palace with you, that I may eat from your plate with you and sleep in your bed.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: justify;">The little princess shuddered at the thought, and almost said, &quot;Are you mad, you filthy slimy creature!&quot; but she stopped herself in time, for she very much wanted her golden ball back.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: justify;">So she said, &quot;Very well. If you fetch my ball, you may come with me to the palace, you may eat from my plate with me, and you may sleep next to me in bed.&quot; Of course, she had no intention of doing that. What was that filthy creature thinking?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_072.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 146%;text-align: left;">The frog dove into the water, came up with the ball and swam to the side.

The princess was startled, for she recognized the croaking voice at once.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The king looked up in surprise. &#39;Who can that be? Open the door,&#39; he said to the princess.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Reluctantly she stood up. And sure enough, on the sidewalk stood the slimy, dirty frog.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">“Go away, you!” she hissed, slamming the door. “Who was that?” demanded the king.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Oh, a frog,” said the little princess, shrugging her shoulders.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;A frog?&#39; asked the king, surprised. &#39;What do you mean, a frog?&#39; &#39;Well,&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">said the little princess, &#39;this morning I was playing with my golden ball and it fell into the pond, and the frog got it out of the water for me.&#39; The king did not understand. &#39;And why is it</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">standing here in front of the door?&#39; he asked.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Well,&quot; said the little princess, &quot;I said he could eat from my plate and sleep in my bed.&quot; The king looked at her very sternly.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;What you promise, you must do,&quot; he said.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The princess began to cry and stamped her feet, &#39;Yes, but I am a princess! And he is only a frog!&#39; Now the king became angry.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;No whining!&#39; he said sternly. &#39;A promise is a promise, and that is especially true of a princess. Let the frog in!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">A moment later the frog was sitting on the table next to the princess&#39;s plate. &#39;Feed me, dear princess, feed me,&#39; he croaked. The king was still looking sternly at the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">princess, so what else could she do? She gave the frog a bite of her</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">raspberry pudding and then she took a bite herself, and so it went back and forth. Raspberry pudding was her favorite dessert, but now she</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">could hardly swallow a bite.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">After dinner, the princess jumped from her chair and ran up the stairs to her bedroom.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Wait, dear princess,&quot; croaked the frog, &quot;wait for me! I can&#39;t run so fast!&quot; But the princess slammed her bedroom door shut with a loud bang.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Now the king was really angry. The princess had to come down again and take the frog to her bedroom. And there she lay, in her soft bed, under the satin sheets, and next to her the dirty, slippery, cold frog, staring at her with his big, shining eyes. &#39;Give me a goodnight kiss, dear princess,&#39; he croaked.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">This is really the last thing I&#39;ll do for him, thought the princess. Tomorrow I&#39;ll throw him out the window, and then I&#39;ll never see him again. With her eyes tightly closed, the princess gave the frog a kiss. And what happened next, you&#39;ll never guess! The princess couldn&#39;t believe it either. When she opened her eyes again, the frog had turned into a handsome prince!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The handsome prince laughed very much when he saw the princess&#39;s surprised face. &#39;Yes, you see,&#39; he explained, &#39;I was not a real frog, I was a prince. A wicked witch had changed me into a frog. I could only become a prince again if I was kissed by a princess. You are a princess, and you have just kissed me, so now I am a prince again.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">As much as the princess had hated the frog, she now loved this handsome prince. Soon they were very much in love. The prince took her to his own country and there they were married. And they lived happily ever after.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="19" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_073.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Now imagine if the little princess hadn&#39;t done what she had promised, then she would never have married this handsome prince. And to be honest: it was a good thing she had such a strict, wise father.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_074.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 157pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">Cinderella</p><h2 style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 20pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there was a man and a woman who had a lot loved each other and had a sweet daughter. Unfortunately,</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">the woman fell ill and after a while she died. It was all very sad, because the</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">little girl was now left alone with her father.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The father was a merchant and often had to travel, and because he did not want his daughter to stay home alone, he remarried after a year.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">His new wife had two daughters. That&#39;s nice, thought the father, because now my daughter not only has a stepmother, but also two stepsisters to</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">play with.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But it turned out differently. Nothing came of that playing. She was a nasty woman,</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">whom the father had married. She spoiled her own daughters terribly. They got everything they wanted, they were allowed to do everything they liked. But the man&#39;s daughter had to scrub the floors all day, wash clothes, fetch water from the well and also cook</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark20">three times a day. Sometimes she was covered in dirt and ashes, and then the stepsisters and the stepmother laughed at her. They called her &#39;Cinderella&#39;.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">While the stepsisters were constantly standing in front of the mirror because they had received yet another new dress, the man&#39;s daughter was walking around in old, torn clothes. She never got anything.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">One day, a few years later, the prince of the country gave a great ball in his palace. All the young girls in the whole country were invited. The</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">stepsisters and the stepmother naturally wanted a beautiful dress to go to the ball, and of course Cinderella had to make it for them, in between all the other work. Until deep into the night, when everyone was long and sound asleep, she sat by a candle cutting and sewing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The day of the party arrived. Cinderella was still busy sewing silk ribbons and bows to the ball gowns. &#39;Aren&#39;t they finished yet?&#39; cried the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_075.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">stepsisters nervous. &#39;Couldn&#39;t you work a little harder?&#39; And that while they themselves had been in bed all day!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">At last, at last, everyone was ready for the party. But when Cinderella wanted to get into the carriage, the stepmother cried out: &#39;What? Did you want to</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">go to the party too?&#39; She took a pan full of peas and emptied it into a pile</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">of ashes. &#39;First, get all those peas out of the ashes. Then we&#39;ll see if you&#39;ve got time for a party!&#39; She got into the carriage with her daughters and drove away. &#39;Besides,&#39; she shouted through the window, &#39;you haven&#39;t even got a ball</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;">gown!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">There sat Cinderella, in the ashes, among the peas, in her torn dress. The prince has invited all the girls in the country, hasn&#39;t he? she thought sadly.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Suddenly a fairy stood before her. &#39;Because you are such a good girl,&#39; she said, &#39;I am going to help you, for I can do magic. Watch out!&#39; She touched Cinderella with her magic wand and… you will never guess what happened next. Her dirty, torn dress changed into a truly beautiful ball gown of silver silk, decorated with gold thread and pearls, and on her feet she had shining glass shoes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Cinderella didn&#39;t know what was happening to her! The fairy took her to</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">the garden and there she turned a pumpkin into a carriage with four horses. She pulled two mice out of the mousetrap and… hopla! There stood a coachman and a footman. &#39;There,&#39; said the fairy, &#39;get in. Have fun at the ball, but remember: the magic only lasts until twelve o&#39;clock tonight. After</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">twelve you will be walking around in your torn clothes, the carriage will be a pumpkin again, and the coachman and footman will be mice again!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The palace was not far. Right at the top, on the seventh floor, was the beautifully decorated ballroom. There were a thousand girls walking around, each more beautiful and richly dressed than the next, and yet… When Cinderella entered, everyone looked at her. Who was that beautiful girl in</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">that gorgeous dress? The prince saw her too, and he danced all evening alone with Cinderella.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_076.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">How happy Cinderella was! She forgot that she would have to dig the peas out of the ashes, that she would have to scrub the floors every day, and fetch water from the well.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She forgot her stepsisters and her stepmother.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">But she also forgot the time! The clock had already begun to strike twelve. In a little while, Cinderella would be wearing her torn clothes again. Luckily, she remembered what the fairy had said just in time. Twelve o’clock! She flew out of the hall, down the stairs, and out the palace gate. In her haste, she lost one of her glass slippers.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The prince ran after her, but when he got down, Cinderella was nowhere to be seen. That was the last minute!</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">When the clock had struck twelve, Cinderella was again wearing her torn clothes, a pumpkin lay on the road, and two mice scurried away squeaking. She ran home and there she hastily gathered all the peas from the ashes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Hours later, her stepsisters and stepmother returned from the ball. They talked of nothing but that beautiful girl with whom the prince had danced all evening. They had not recognized Cinderella at all, that was clear. The prince, meanwhile, was very sad. He wanted very much to marry Cinderella, but he did not know where she was or what her name was. He only had her glass slipper. Do you know what, he thought, I am going to travel through the whole country and let all the girls try on the slipper. That way I must find her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">No sooner said than done. Wherever he went, the girls had to try on the shoe. For one it was too big and for the other too small, for one it was too</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">wide and for the other too narrow. Finally, he also came to Cinderella&#39;s house.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The two stepsisters tried with all their might to squeeze their big feet into the little shoe, but of course that didn&#39;t work.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Disappointed, the prince wanted to travel on, when he saw Cinderella sitting through the kitchen window. &#39;I want her to try the shoe too,&#39; he said.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">&quot;That dirty child?&quot; cried the two stepsisters and the stepmother at once. &quot;She never went to the ball.&quot; But the prince did not listen.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">Cinderella had to sit down and look… the shoe fit perfectly! Then the prince recognized her and, overjoyed, he took her to his palace.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">The stepmother and the two stepsisters were left with their mouths open. How was it possible that the beautiful girl from the ball was</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">their ugly dirty Cinderella! And who was supposed to do all the housework? The two sisters didn&#39;t feel like it at all, and of course the mother didn&#39;t either, so it quickly became a terrible mess, I think.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 112%;text-align: left;">And Cinderella? She lived in a beautiful castle and had a hundred ladies-in-waiting. She didn&#39;t have to lift a finger and lived happily ever after with her prince. <span><img width="15" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_077.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="208" height="37" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_078.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s36" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The dancing violin</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there was a boy who was so small and thin was that everyone called him shrimp. His father thought it was time</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">for him to work. But everyone he asked for work said &#39;no&#39;. Because what kind of work could such a skinny boy do?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">One day, miraculously, the boy did find work. It was with a judge, an old, nasty, and greedy man. I&#39;ll make him work hard, the rascal thought, and I&#39;ll pay him nothing. He can&#39;t get work anywhere else. And you know what?</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">I&#39;ll fire the maid and the manservant, and I&#39;ll let that shrimp do everything. That&#39;ll save me a lot of money. Because the boy had to work for two, he had to get up at six every day, even on Sundays, and then work until</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">late at night. He did get to eat three times a day - whatever the judge left on his plate because he didn&#39;t like it, that was for him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark21">His clothes soon became worn out from all that work. They hung like rags on his thin body and his shoes were full of holes.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">Three years passed like this. One day the judge thought: what will people think of my servant being so thin and looking so dirty? But of course he didn&#39;t feel like buying him new clothes and shoes, so he decided to fire him.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">But now the boy asked for his wages.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">&quot;What do you mean, wages? I never said anything about wages,&quot; the judge said sullenly. But then he thought: What will people say when</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">they hear that I never paid my servant? So he reluctantly took his fat purse out of a drawer and grumblingly gave the boy three cents. &quot;A cent for every year you&#39;ve worked here, that&#39;s more than enough,&quot; he grumbled. &quot;Now get out of</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">here.&quot; And that was all the boy could do. Three cents for three years isn&#39;t much, but he&#39;d never had any money before, so he was quite happy with it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_079.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">He went on his way happily. At a grassy field he sat down on a stone, took the three cents out of his pocket and counted them over and over again.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">One, two, three. One, two, three.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Suddenly a thin old man stood before him. &#39;Can I have a cent from you?&#39; he asked in a weak voice. &#39;I haven&#39;t eaten anything all day.&#39; The boy actually wanted</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">to give the cents to his father, but he felt so sorry for the little man that he said: &#39;Yes, sir!&#39; and gave him a cent.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The man snatched the coin from his hand and disappeared without even saying thank you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The boy walked on. After a while he sat down on a tree trunk and counted his pennies again. One, two. One, two. And there stood another old man in front of him. This one was even thinner and his clothes were very worn. &#39;Please,&#39;</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">he begged softly, &#39;can I have a penny from you?</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I haven&#39;t eaten for five days.&#39; Five</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">days without eating? That was really bad! The boy gave him a penny and said, &#39;Actually, these pennies are for my father, but he eats every day, so he won&#39;t mind if I give you a penny.&#39; The old man put the penny in his pocket and disappeared, again without saying thank you.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Now the boy had only one cent left. My father will get it, the boy said to himself. One is not much, but one is still more than nothing.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">But after half an hour he came across another old man, who was even thinner and looked much worse than the previous two. He also asked for a penny, because he had not eaten for a week.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">&#39;Well, all right then,&#39; said the boy, &#39;here&#39;s my last cent. Because I wouldn&#39;t wish that on anyone to go a week without food.&#39; And then something</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">wonderful happened...</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The third man turned into the second man and then into the first man and then he became a very well dressed gentleman.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_080.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Since you have such a good heart,&quot; he said, &quot;I will grant you three wishes, and I will grant them all. Whatever you ask.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The boy could think of nothing at first, but after some thought he said, &#39;I&#39;ve always wanted to be able to play the violin. I&#39;d like a violin - one that sounds so beautiful that everyone has to dance when they hear me play.&#39; &#39;If that&#39;s what you want so much,&#39; said the dignified gentleman, &#39;then I&#39;ll be happy.&#39; He snapped his fingers, and the boy held</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a violin and a bow in his hands.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“And what is your second wish?” the man asked.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;I&#39;ve always wanted to shoot very well,&#39; said the boy, &#39;but all guns are too big and too heavy for me. I&#39;d like so much to have a little gun that would always hit the target.&#39;</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;If that&#39;s what you want so much,&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">said the man, &#39;then I&#39;ll be happy.&#39; And there lay a little gun on the ground next to the boy. &#39;Now your last wish,&#39; said the man.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;m so sick of everyone always saying &#39;no&#39; to me. I wish people would say &#39;yes&#39; when I ask them for something.&quot; &quot;This wish will come true too,&quot; the man said.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A small pop... and he was gone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The boy walked on again. He was so happy with the violin and the gun that he did not pay attention, took the wrong road and got lost. He came to a strange city and went looking for a tailor. There he asked for a set of nice clothes, and he honestly said that unfortunately he had no money.</p><p style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 36pt;text-align: left;">And then the third wish came true: the tailor had no choice but to say &#39;yes&#39;. He was given a beautiful suit of shiny silk with many bows and ribbons.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The boy thanked him heartily and then went to a man who sold carriages. There he asked for a beautiful carriage with horses and again he said that unfortunately he had no money. And this man also said &#39;yes&#39; and gave the boy a beautiful carriage - one with golden curls. And he also got two beautiful white horses with it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_081.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And there he rode, the boy, in those beautiful clothes and in that beautiful carriage.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">From the other side came a carriage too – an ordinary one, without golden curls and with only one horse. And who was in it? The wicked judge!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Good morning, boss,&quot; greeted the boy, &quot;how are you?&quot; The judge leaned out of the window, not recognizing the boy in those fine clothes, and said, &quot;Good morning to you too, but why do you call me boss?&quot; &quot;Because I worked for you for three</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">years,&quot; said the boy.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Ah,&quot; said the judge, &quot;now I see!&quot; He looked at the carriage and the fine clothes, and said, &quot;Well, well. I can see you&#39;ve come far.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; said the boy</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">cheerfully, &quot;you see what you can do with three cents!&quot; &quot;And what do I see there, have you got a gun?&quot; asked the judge. &quot;Yes,&quot; said the boy, &quot;and I bet you I can hit anything with it.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The judge immediately came up with another mean plan. &#39;Anything, you say? You can hit anything I point to? Are you sure? Well, okay. If you win, you get three hundred pieces of money, and if I win, you work for me for thirty years, for nothing.&#39; The boy</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">nodded and picked up the gun. &#39;You tell me what to hit.&#39; The judge pointed to a rock in the distance. &#39;See that dot on that rock over there?</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">That&#39;s a tower. And on that tower is a flagpole. I know that right in the middle of that pole is a red line. I want you to hit the flagpole right in that red line.&#39; The</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">judge laughed up his sleeve. &#39;Well, you know what? I don&#39;t want to be childish. I&#39;ll bet you double, so six hundred pieces.&#39; Because he was sure he would win the bet.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The boy aimed and fired. Since they couldn&#39;t see from so far away whether the stick had really hit the red line exactly, they drove over.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The shot piece lay in the bushes and the red line had indeed hit precisely. The judge could not believe his eyes. Growling, he pulled out his fat money bag and angrily threw a hundred coins at the boy.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“You&#39;ll get no more!” he snapped, and rode on.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The boy walked on and slept that night in an inn. In the middle of the night three gendarmes took him out of bed. &#39;The judge says that you stole a hundred coins from him!&#39; they said.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">They searched his clothes and found the money. And no matter what the boy said, it didn&#39;t help. They dragged him away and threw him in jail. He just managed to get his violin.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">&quot;I&#39;m not a thief,&quot; the boy shouted again. &quot;I bet honestly with the judge and I won!&quot; But no one believed him, because a judge surely doesn&#39;t lie?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The boy was sentenced to death. He was to be hanged in the middle</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">of the square. The square was full of people. Everyone wanted to see how it was done, hanging someone. Before the boy got the rope around his neck, he asked if he could play the violin for the last time. He was allowed to, because no one could say &#39;no&#39; to him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The boy began to play, and immediately the first wish came true.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Everyone started dancing, whether they wanted to or not. The man who had to hang him made the most beautiful hopping steps, to his own surprise,</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">the guards jumped up and down, neatly in time. Men and women and children, everyone danced. The judge too. He was furious. He tried to dance towards the boy, but his legs danced the other way.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The people shouted: &#39;Stop, stop, we can&#39;t do it anymore!&#39; but the boy kept on playing, and after a while he climbed down from the scaffold while playing. He walked through the dancing crowd down the village square. When he was so far away that they could no longer hear his violin, everyone fell down exhausted. The judge too. &#39;Catch him! Catch the thief!&#39; he shouted, but</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">everyone stayed down and then the judge became so angry that he fell down dead.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="19" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_082.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The boy arrived home to his father without any further exciting events and he was doing very well. He lived very contentedly, because no one could say &#39;no&#39; to him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="345" height="45" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_083.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Princess and the Pea</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there was a prince who wanted to marry. Not just anyone, but a princess, and a princess at that</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">real. Are there also fake princesses? you may wonder.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 157%;text-align: left;">Oh yes! This prince could tell you everything about it. To find a real princess, he went out into the world. Everywhere he met girls who said they were princesses, and later he found out that that was not true at all!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">When after a year he still had not found a real princess, he went home to the castle of his parents, the king and queen.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">His mother said, &quot;Don&#39;t give up hope, boy, one day you&#39;ll find your real princess,&quot; and she kissed him goodnight. &quot;Now go to sleep.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark22">One evening very late, the prince had long gone to bed, there was a knocking on the palace door. &#39;Who is still outside in this weather?&#39; the king said to the queen in surprise, because it was storming like it had never stormed before. The rain was pouring down from the sky. There was thunder and lightning one after the other, a terrible evening.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The king opened the door and let in a soaking wet girl.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">&quot;I am a princess,&quot; she said. &quot;I was walking in the woods when the storm suddenly broke. I lost my ladies-in-waiting and got lost. I wandered around for hours and hours... Then I saw this castle...&quot; She couldn&#39;t say more, she was so tired.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The queen had a guest room prepared for the girl, but before she went to bed she was first given dry clothes and a hot meal.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">&quot;She says she&#39;s a princess,&quot; the king whispered to the queen. &quot;But is that really true? It seems like everyone is a princess these days.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot;</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the queen whispered back, &quot;could she be a real one?&quot; &quot;How do we find</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">out?&quot; the king said softly. &quot;She has good manners and she speaks nicely, but that doesn&#39;t mean anything.&quot; Then the queen had an idea.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the bed where the girl would sleep, the queen placed a pea.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On top of that she put a mattress, and on top of that another mattress,</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">and another, and another, until there were twenty-seven mattresses on top of each other. And on top of that came ten of the softest down blankets. It looked a bit strange, such a high bed, but the queen knew what she was doing. When the girl had finished eating she wanted to go straight to bed, because she was dead tired – and that was no wonder. She had to climb into the bed with a ladder, it was so high.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The next morning the girl came to breakfast looking a little pale. The king and queen asked curiously if she had slept well.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">&#39;No, not at all,&#39; said the girl, &#39;I&#39;ve had a terrible night. I haven&#39;t slept a wink, because I was lying on something hard. Heaven knows what it was, but my back is all black and blue.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Then the king and queen knew that they had found a wife for their son. Because only a real princess had such tender and sensitive skin, only a real princess could feel a pea through that pile of mattresses and blankets. Clever thinking, by that queen! <span><img width="15" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_084.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_085.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s38" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 82pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">King Thrushbeard</p><h2 style="padding-top: 12pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 23pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there lived an old king who had a very beautiful daughter. All the kings, princes and dukes wanted to marry her,</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">but the princess was quite conceited and thought herself far too beautiful for any man. Her father, the old king, was rather sickly and thought: I want her to be married when I die. Because who else will take care of her?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He gave a great party. Everyone who wanted to marry her was</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">invited. And they came, from far and wide, on horseback or in a carriage: the</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">kings, the princes, the counts, in short, everyone who was of noble birth was.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">At the party, all the guests had to stand next to each other and from that long line the princess had to choose a man. The king and the princess walked along the long line of powerful and rich men. And what did the princess do? She laughed at them all!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark23">A thin king she called asparagus. A somewhat fat earl she called teapot.</a></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">One had a head like a potato, another had a neck like a turkey, and a third was as handsome as a warthog. But she made herself especially happy about the last king, because he happened to have a rather long chin.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">&quot;Hahaha,&quot; she laughed. &quot;No, his chin looks like a thrush&#39;s beak.&quot; Everyone called</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">him King Thrushbeard after that.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The princess&#39;s father was deeply ashamed. After the party he said to his daughter: &#39;You have behaved terribly. As punishment you will marry the first beggar who comes along!&#39; The king&#39;s daughter shrugged her shoulders. That&#39;s all right, she thought.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: justify;">A few days later there was singing at the front door. It was a poor wanderer, who was trying to earn some money by singing. The king called him upstairs and said: &#39;How beautifully you sing! As a reward, you may sing with my</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_086.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">daughter to marry.&#39; The princess fell from her chair when she heard this, but the old king was not to be dissuaded from his plan. The next day they were married, and as soon</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">as the marriage was completed the king said to his daughter: &#39;You are now the wife of a beggar, and beggars do not live in a palace.&#39; With these words he chased them out</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">into the street.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">The beggar took his wife by the hand and walked out of the city. After days of walking through wind and weather and sleeping under the open sky, they ended up in another country. When they passed a large forest, she asked who the forest belonged to.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The beggar said, &#39;The forest belongs to King Thrushbeard. And if you had not laughed at him so, this forest would now have been yours.&#39; The king&#39;s daughter sighed</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">deeply. Then they passed vast cornfields.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Whose cornfields are these?” asked the princess.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;They belong to King Thrushbeard,&#39; answered the beggar. &#39;And if you had not laughed at him so, all these cornfields would now have been yours!&#39; The king&#39;s daughter thought to herself: I have been stupid. Then they came to a small, crooked hut.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;And whose poor little house is that?&#39; asked the princess.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;That is yours and mine,&#39; said the beggar. &#39;This is where we live. And you can start working right away. Take off your wig and put on this old dress, for a beggar&#39;s wife does not wear wigs and does not go around in ball gowns. And then make something to eat, for I am dead tired and hungry.&#39; But the beggar was out of luck, for the princess</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">could not cook at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The man shook his head in disbelief and then went on to prepare the food himself.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;I don&#39;t earn enough for both of us by singing,&#39; said the beggar the next day. &#39;You must bring in some money too.&#39; He went out and cut some branches from a willow. &#39;Make some baskets out of these, and you can sell them in the market.&#39; But the princess was so clumsy that she cut her fingers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;You can&#39;t do anything either!&#39; grumbled the beggar. &#39;Then go and weave, and we can sell the cloth at the market.&#39; But even there the princess brought nothing</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_087.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">of right.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;What good are you to me?!&quot; the beggar exclaimed in annoyance. &quot;What good are you to me?&quot; The princess looked down at the ground, deeply ashamed.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">“You know what,” the beggar then said, “I&#39;ll find some pots that you can sell at the market.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">No sooner said than done. The next morning, before dawn, the beggar loaded a pile of pots onto a cart and had the princess push it to the market. She set out her wares in</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">a sunny spot and it soon became apparent that the princess was a good market trader.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Business was good. People liked to buy from her because she was so beautiful and every day she came home with enough money to buy bread.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The beggar was satisfied. &#39;With my singing and your pots we will at least have something to eat every day,&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">His wife looked at him gratefully. For the first time, her husband wasn&#39;t angry with her.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">One day she was sitting in the market again when suddenly a drunken horseman came storming up and galloped right through her pots. Everything was in shards!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When she got home the beggar was furious. &#39;Who is so stupid as to sit in that place?&#39;</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">he raged. &#39;You know that many horsemen pass by there? What use is a stupid goose like you to me!&#39; The princess wept bitterly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Fortunately, her husband was in a better mood the next day. &quot;We are lucky,&quot; he said, when he came home from singing. &quot;I hear the king&#39;s cook needs a kitchen helper.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You can start tomorrow.&quot;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And so the princess came to work in the palace kitchen. She sewed seven small pots into her apron, and filled them every day with the leftovers of the royal meal. When she came home in the evening, she would set the table and then she and her husband would eat the leftovers.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">One day the king gave a party. The princess hid behind a curtain and spied on all the noble and beautifully dressed guests. She</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">tears came into her eyes. How sorry she was! Because she had been so mean to all those kings and princes who wanted to marry her, she was now a kitchen helper!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Suddenly the curtain she was standing behind was pulled aside. A handsome young man pulled her into the ballroom. In the canal the pots fell out of her apron and the food scraps</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">flew across the dance floor. Everyone saw it and started laughing. What was that dirty woman doing with all that food?</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The princess could have sunk through the ground with shame.</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">She wanted to run away, but the young man stopped her. Suddenly she recognized him: It was her own husband!</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">She didn&#39;t understand it. How did he get those beautiful clothes? &#39;That&#39;s a long story,&#39; her husband said, as he took her in his arms. &#39;I am the king. I pretended to be a poor beggar living in a hut. I was also that drunken rider in the market. And do you know why?</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">To teach you a lesson, because you made a fool of me and everyone else at that party back then.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">When King Thrushbeard – for that was the one it was – had said this, he had a beautiful ball gown brought. &#39;Put this on,&#39; he said, &#39;and we will dance.&#39; And so they did, until deep into the night.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">So now she was no longer married to a beggar, but to a king!</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-bottom: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">She lived happily ever after in his beautiful palace. She was still as beautiful as ever, but much, much nicer, and she was certainly no longer conceited. Her husband&#39;s chin was still quite large, but she never laughed about it again, because she knew all too well now what it felt like to be laughed at.</p><p style="padding-left: 150pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_088.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="330" height="45" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_089.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 2pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 33pt;text-align: left;">The three oranges</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there was a king who had a beautiful</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 35pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">daughter. He was crazy about her, so when she was old enough to get married, he didn&#39;t like it at all. He didn&#39;t want her to get married, because then she would go and live somewhere else and he thought that would be very unsociable. But hey, a princess has to get married, that&#39;s just the way it is...</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">Then the king thought of something clever. He had a high glass mountain built, and right at the top he had a throne placed. The princess had to sit on it, with three oranges on</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">her lap. Then he let everyone in the whole country know that whoever could get the oranges would be allowed to marry the princess.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">Well, everyone wanted that, because she was a very beautiful girl. The king secretly hoped that no one would succeed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In that same country there lived a farmer with three sons. The two oldest boys were</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark24">big and strong; he was proud of that. But the youngest was rather small and slender.</a></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">The farmer didn&#39;t like that very much, so he let him do all the dirty work. For example, the boy had to clean the cow and pig stalls every day, and because of that he always smelled of shit and pee.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">The farmer was quite rich, because besides all those animals he also had twelve extensive meadows with tall, tender grass, where his cows grazed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">One morning the farmer woke up and saw through the window that all the grass in one meadow had been mown. The farmer did not understand. Who had done that?</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The meadow was completely bare – there was not a blade of grass to be seen.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">The next day another meadow had been mown, and then the farmer really began to worry. &#39;You go and watch the meadows tonight,&#39; he said to his eldest son. &#39;I want to know who is mowing them.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_090.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">When it grew dark, the eldest son sat down under a tree. But at midnight he fell asleep. The next morning, when he awoke, another meadow had been mown, but of course the boy could not say who had done it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">That night the father had the second son watch. But that boy also fell asleep and again a meadow was mown, and the second son also could not tell who the mower was.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">Then the third son said he wanted to try it.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The father and his two brothers laughed at him. &#39;You? If we can&#39;t do it, how can you?&#39; And they threw rotten eggs in his face!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">But the youngest son did it anyway. When it began to get dark, he sat down under the tree and pinched himself every few minutes to stay awake.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">At exactly midnight the earth suddenly began to shake violently. The tree shook back and forth, and there was a deafening sound of hoofbeats, which quickly came closer. The boy quickly climbed the tree and saw a</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">snow-white horse galloping towards him. It began to graze near the meadow.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The boy couldn&#39;t take his eyes off the horse, and as it passed under the tree, he threw himself onto its back. The horse reared slightly, so the</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">boy grabbed its mane tightly. Then it trotted off into the forest, with the boy on its back.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The next morning the boy came home walking and said: &#39;You can sleep peacefully from now on. The meadows will not be mown anymore, I have seen to that.&#39; His father and brothers laughed at him again. &#39;Yes, we will believe that right away!&#39; And they threw rotten pears at him. But the boy was right: the meadows were not mown anymore.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Then they heard on the farm about the princess on the glass mountain. And the eldest son said at once: &#39;Father, I will try to get those three oranges, because it seems to</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">me a good idea to marry a princess.&#39; &#39;Son,&#39; said the father, &#39;that will not be</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">easy, for how do you get up such a slippery mountain?&#39; &#39;Oh,&#39; said the eldest, &#39;I will think of something.&#39;</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;I will help you,&#39; said the second son.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_091.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The youngest wanted to come along too, but the other two said very meanly: &#39;We don&#39;t want a stinker like you!&#39; And they threw rotten tomatoes at his head.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The two brothers set out at once. From afar they saw the palace.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The glass mountain in the garden glittered in the sun, and on top of it sat the breathtakingly beautiful princess on a throne – with the three oranges on her lap.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Many princes, dukes and even common men had tried to climb the mountain, but none had succeeded and the king was laughing up his sleeve.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now it was the two brothers&#39; turn. After one step on the glass mountain, they</p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">slid down again. The king laughed at them and sent them home immediately. But before they had even turned around, something very special happened...</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">A prince came riding up on a white horse, dressed in armor of shining steel. He stormed up the glass mountain. The princess couldn&#39;t even see his face, it all happened so fast, but she could smell him!</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">&quot;I won&#39;t marry such a stinker,&quot; she said. She held her nose and threw an orange at the horse&#39;s head. That startled the animal, and horse, prince, and orange slid— whoosh!—down.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">When they got home, the brothers excitedly told them about the prince on the horse. &quot;You should have seen him!&quot; they cried. &quot;The prince looked splendid!&quot; &quot;What</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">a pity I wasn&#39;t there,&quot; sighed the youngest brother. And the two eldest threw rotten green beans at his head.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s18" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The next day the two brothers tried again. This time they took an axe with them, and with that axe they tried to cut steps in the glass. But the glass was much too hard!</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The king laughed at them and sent them home again. And there came the same prince galloping on his white horse again. This time he wore silver armor. He stormed up the mountain again and came a little closer to the princess. This time too she turned up her nose when she smelled him, but when she saw his face… she was immediately head over heels in love. Quickly</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_092.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">she threw him an orange. He just managed to catch it before he slid down again, horse and all.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 121%;text-align: left;">At home, the two brothers were again full of praise for the unknown prince: &#39;You should have seen him!&#39; they said to their youngest brother – just to tease him and make him jealous.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">&quot;I wish I&#39;d been there,&quot; the youngest sighed again. His brothers threw rotten apples at his head.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The next day the brothers went up the mountain again – now with nails under their shoes. But the nails were of no use at all and after only</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">three steps they slid down. And there came the prince again on his horse.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now he was completely covered in gold. He stormed up the mountain</p><p class="s10" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">again and could almost touch the princess’s legs, almost… But before he slid down again, the princess quickly put the third orange in his hand. In a</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">flash the prince had disappeared into the forest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">What a commotion! The prince now had all three oranges and was allowed to marry the princess, but where was he? And who was he? No one knew…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The princess in love now wanted to find her prince at all costs, and even though the king still did not like her getting married, he decided to help her anyway. After all, he was crazy about her.</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">He announced that all the men of the country had to come to the palace. So the two eldest brothers also went. The youngest was of course not allowed to come, but he secretly went anyway…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">The palace was crowded with men. The princess looked at them all, one by one, but her prince was not among them. When she had <i><b>almost </b></i>seen everyone, she suddenly smelled a familiar scent: shit and pee. The princess turned around with her nose in the air, followed the scent sniffing and</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">found the youngest brother, hiding behind a tree. She did not even recognize him in his dirty torn cloak!</p><p class="s10" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">Then the boy took the three oranges out of his pockets and took off his cloak, and everyone shouted, &#39;Oooh!&#39;</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For what was underneath? A golden armor!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">At a fountain in the courtyard of the castle he washed his face. And now she recognized him. The boy and the princess embraced, they were married, and they lived happily ever after.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The white horse, which was of course a magic horse, was now allowed to graze wherever it wanted. And the father and the two brothers? They regretted that they had treated the boy so meanly. But that had been</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="19" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_093.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">his good fortune, because if he had not stank so much – of shit and pee and rotten things – the princess would never have found him among all those men. All&#39;s well that ends well, then! But not for the king. He found it boring, all alone in that big palace.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="475" height="45" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_094.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s17" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 34pt;text-align: left;">The Pied Piper of Hamelin</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h3 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 51pt;text-align: left;">S</h3><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 39pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">IMAGINE if there were rats running around the room – big, fat, black rats on the chairs, on the tables, in the cupboards, rats that</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">rats crawled over your belly and legs, rats gnawed at your ears… They were everywhere, wherever you looked – in your bed, in the kitchen, on the streets, on the roofs! When you ate, rats took your bread. In the toilet, rats bit your bottom…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 133%;text-align: left;">Well, this happened long ago in a town called Hamelin. The people were desperate. Even if they killed three hundred rats every day, the next day there were four hundred more. The people closed up all the holes and cracks in their houses. They didn&#39;t dare go out anymore, because outside there was nothing but squeaking, creaking, gnawing and</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the scratching of rats&#39; paws on the paving stones.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And then, suddenly, on a bleak day, while dark clouds raced across the sky, there stood in the middle of the square, among all those rats, a strange man. His wide black cloak fluttered in the wind. Who he was, where he came from, nobody knew. People peered at him through the curtains. He walked to the mayor&#39;s house.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark25">&quot;I can get rid of the rats in one day,&quot; he said, &quot;because I&#39;m a rat catcher.&quot; &quot;Really, in one</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">day?&quot; asked the mayor. &quot;Are you sure? All those thousands of rats?&quot; &quot;Yes, believe me. No one can do it</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">but me,&quot; said the man.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The mayor fell to his knees and said, &#39;If you can rid us of this plague, we will be eternally grateful to you. Ask for whatever you want and you will have it, for this is no life.&#39; &#39;There are five hundred</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">families in Hamelin,&#39; said the Pied Piper, &#39;and I ask each family for two gold pieces; that makes a thousand gold pieces in all.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_095.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">&quot;And if we find another rat in Hamelin after all,&quot; asked the mayor, &quot;what then?&quot;</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Then you don&#39;t have to pay me anything,&quot; said the Pied Piper.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The mayor immediately called all the inhabitants of Hamelin to the church and told them about the Pied Piper. Everyone started talking at once. Everyone wanted to pay those two gold coins, or even ten or twenty, if only the man could rid them of that terrible rat plague. When the stranger heard this, he nodded. &#39;I&#39;ll start tonight, when the moon rises. No one is allowed to go outside, everyone must stay</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">inside. And have the reward ready, because I&#39;ll come and get it soon.&#39; And he was gone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">It became evening, and when the moon rose, the people saw from behind their curtains the Pied Piper standing in the square, among all the rats. He took out a long silver flute and began to play. It was a very thin and thin tune, so strange that the people held their breath.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They had never heard anything like it before. And then, from everywhere, from</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">holes and cracks and holes and crevices, the rats came out. The square became more and more crowded. When there were no more rats, the man, still playing his flute, walked down the main street, out of the village. The rats followed him in long lines, through woods and over fields. At a wide river that flowed to the sea, he stopped.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The rats seemed to be enchanted. They all jumped into the water, hundreds at a time, and swam to the sea.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The people in the village were dancing and singing in the streets. They could hardly believe it. There really wasn&#39;t a rat to be seen! They could laugh again and go shopping, eat and sleep normally. And after a week they had even forgotten about the rats a little.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The mayor came along and asked each family for two gold coins for the rat catcher. A thousand gold coins, the people grumbled, wasn&#39;t that a bit much? And for what? Maybe the rats would have gone away by themselves one day. Maybe that man wasn&#39;t needed at all</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">been. Ten gold coins instead of a thousand, that was more than enough, everyone thought. And actually the mayor thought so too.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">A few days later the Pied Piper came to get his thousand gold pieces. &#39;We think ten gold pieces are more than enough,&#39; said the mayor, &#39;for who is to</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">say that the rats will not come back?&#39; The Pied Piper became very angry and threw the gold pieces on the floor.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;You keep your ten gold pieces. But you will regret this.&#39; And he was gone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Well, people thought that was absolutely wonderful. They were rid of the plague and it didn&#39;t cost them a cent!</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The next night they all went to church to talk about the Pied Piper. He</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">was really a fraud, they said. A thousand gold pieces! Did the man really think they were so stupid?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">It wasn&#39;t until the sun was almost up that everyone went home. But there they were in for a shock! All the children in the town had disappeared! People didn&#39;t understand. Where on earth were they?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then a little boy came crawling out from under a bed in a house somewhere.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He told them that the Pied Piper had come back and had played his flute in</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">the square. All the children had gotten out of their beds and followed him out of the town. That was all he knew.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Everyone grabbed a stick or a club and ran in the direction the boy pointed them. They could easily follow the many footprints of the children. They went into the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">mountains. But suddenly the track ended, right in front of a steep rock face. It seemed as if they had disappeared into the rock. It was a mystery! How could all those</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">children just disappear into a rock?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The mystery was never solved. The children were never found.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">No one has ever heard or seen anything from them again. Of course, what the Pied Piper did, luring all the children away from the town, is not good. But then again, if you</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">promise something, you have to do it. Right?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 77pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_096.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_097.jpg"/></span></p><h1 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 61pt;text-align: left;">O</h1><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The Prince Kitten</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">P ONCE again there was war somewhere. A country wanted a another country and sent armies to it. The soldiers set fire to</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: justify;">everything they could find and then stormed the king&#39;s palace. The king and queen were killed, but their children - the prince and princess - they could not find. They had escaped through a secret door and fled straight into the forest.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The prince and the princess did not dare to rest for a moment, and ran further and further away from the palace and the soldiers, and so they got deeper and deeper into the forest. The little prince became very thirsty, and that is no wonder, after all that</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 10pt;text-align: left;">to run.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Luckily, they saw a little lake glistening between the trees a little</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">further away. The boy ran towards it. But his sister didn&#39;t trust it. She saw that there were horses all over the bank. And they all looked equally</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">sad.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">&quot;No! Don&#39;t drink!&quot; cried the girl. &quot;Perhaps that lake is enchanted. Those horses must be people who drank from the water.&#39; They walked on and soon came to another small lake.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark26">The boy bent over to drink, but here were all the dogs standing along the bank, who also looked very sad. Again the princess shouted that he should not drink, that those dogs must have been people who had drunk</a></p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 16pt;text-align: left;">from the water. So they walked on. The prince said that he would die if</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">he did not get something to drink soon. Then they saw another lake. Here were all the cats along the bank. The princess shouted that he should</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">not drink, but it was too late. Her little brother had already taken a sip and turned into a kitten before her eyes!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">The princess screamed in horror. But there was not much time to grieve, because the gunshots of the soldiers sounded much too close. She picked up the kitten and ran on, for days on end.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_098.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Thus they came to a strange land. At the king&#39;s palace the cat wriggled free, and before the princess could do anything, it had disappeared into the palace garden.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“What are you doing?” cried the princess in alarm, and she ran after the kitten.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The king happened to be standing at the window and had seen everything. He found her so beautiful that he called her in and asked her to marry him.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Yes, I will,&quot; said the girl, &quot;but only if I can always keep my kitten with me.&quot; The king agreed, of course. So two days later they were married.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now not far from the palace lived a witch, who was in love with the king.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">But the king would have nothing to do with her, because who would fall in love with a witch? She became incredibly jealous when she heard about the wedding.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">One day the princess (who was now queen) was walking with the kitten in the palace garden.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Suddenly the witch stood before her and said: &#39;You have married the king, but he would much rather have married me. So it is better that you go away.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Of course the girl didn&#39;t want that.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Then I will make you sick,&quot; cried the witch, &quot;so sick that you will sit all day long in a chair, exhausted, and will not feel like doing anything.&quot; And that</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">is what happened. The king did not like it at all that his wife sat exhausted in a chair all day long, staring into space, and did not even feel like eating or drinking.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">One day, out of nowhere, the witch suddenly stood before the queen again. &#39;I have grieved over my heart,&#39; she said. &#39;I will make you better again. Go to the lake behind the palace. Undress there and take a bath.&#39; And she was gone. With great</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">difficulty the queen dragged herself to the lake. She undressed and was just about to step into the water, when the witch jumped out from behind a tree. She had a thick rope with her, to which a stone was tied. In a flash she tied the rope around the queen&#39;s waist.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She threw the stone into the water with a cackling laugh.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">water.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_099.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">The queen was dragged along by the rope. With a splash she disappeared into the lake and sank immediately to the bottom. She tried to untie the rope, but the knot was so tight that it could not be untied. The kitten had fled behind a tree in fright, but the princess did not come up again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 155%;text-align: left;">The witch rubbed her hands, laughed that cackle again, put on the queen&#39;s clothes and transformed her ugly face into the queen&#39;s beautiful face. And so she walked to the king.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;">He was of course very happy to see his wife so cheerful again. &#39;Where is your cat?&#39; he</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">asked, because his wife always had the animal with her.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 298%;text-align: left;">&quot;Oh, that childish nonsense,&quot; said the witch. &quot;I have no idea where that beast is.&quot; The king thought that was strange, but he did not think about it for long.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: left;">One day, when the witch was alone with the cat, she said to the little animal, &#39;When I see you,</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">I think of your sister, and I don&#39;t want to think about that at all.&#39; The cat was terrified and ran into the garden to the lake.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">&quot;Sister, sister,&quot; meowed the kitten, &quot;I think the witch wants to kill me. Help me!&quot; &quot;Brother,&quot; cried the girl from</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">the bottom of the lake, &quot;I can do nothing. I am tied to that boulder.&#39;</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">The king happened to be walking around nearby and heard that. He recognized his wife&#39;s voice and immediately understood what was going on. He didn&#39;t think twice, jumped into the water, and cut the rope with a knife.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">The three of them walked back to the palace. The witch was terrified, you understand, when she saw the king and queen and the kitten together.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;I should really throw you into the lake,&#39; said the king to the witch, &#39;with a stone around your neck.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">But if you bring the cat back, I will let you live.&#39; The witch began to swear and rant. She now looked as she really did: a mean face with a hooked nose and a jutting chin.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">&quot;Be careful,&quot; said the king, taking a step toward her, &quot;or I&#39;ll throw you into the lake.&quot; Now</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">witches hate water, so she had to do what the king wanted. She couldn&#39;t do</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">otherwise. She muttered a few spells, and the kitten became a prince again.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">And then the witch also had to bring back all the horses, dogs and cats, because, yes yes, it was she who had bewitched all those people at the lakes.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">She was allowed to live, but she was locked up. And she had to take a bath every day, which caused her to lose her magic after a while. Every now and then she was allowed outside, but under strict supervision.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The king now finally heard the whole story of the war. He sent a great army to his wife&#39;s country and drove the enemy away.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Now the king had two countries. But he didn&#39;t mind at all.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="19" height="19" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_100.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">On the contrary.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="490" height="45" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_101.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s40" style="padding-left: 1pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 31pt;text-align: left;">One-eye, Two-eye, Three-eye</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">E</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 43pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">R ONCE WAS a woman who had three daughters.

That&#39;s why the girls were called One-eye, Two-eye and Three-eye.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The mother was proud of One-eye and Three-eye - at least they had something special.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She thought Two-eye was just ordinary, so she had to do all the work in the house and</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">in the garden and take the goat to the pasture every day. And she also had to provide food three times a day. The mother, One-eye and Three-eye would first eat until they were full, they threw the leftovers in a corner, those were for Two-eye. Two-eye&#39;s stomach growled with hunger when she had to take the goat to the pasture.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One day, in the meadow, Two-Eyes could bear it no longer and began to cry terribly.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Suddenly an old woman stood before her. &#39;Why are you crying, girl?&#39; she asked.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 10pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: justify;">&#39;I am so hungry,&#39; said Two-Eyes. &#39;My mother and my two sisters eat their fill every day, and I only get the leftovers.&#39; &#39;Don&#39;t cry any more,&#39; said the old</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark27">woman. &#39;Because you are such a good girl, I will help you. From now on, when you are hungry again, you must just go to your goat and say: &quot;Goat, mek, table, set!&quot; Then you will see something!&#39; And suddenly she was gone.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">Well, something like that doesn&#39;t happen every day, so Two-Eyes immediately went to the goat and said: &#39;Goat, mek, table set!&#39; And hardly had she said that when there was a neatly laid table, and she could feast on veal croquettes, cabbage rolls, a golden yellow pudding and a large glass of cold cherry lemonade.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">At home she had to cook immediately, because her mother and sisters were already shouting: &#39;Where is our food!&#39; After the meal they fell on the couch, burping,</p><p class="s3" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">to watch how Tweeoogje would eat the leftovers. But today Tweeoogje had no appetite at all, after all that</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_102.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">veal croquettes, cabbage rolls, that golden pudding and the big glass of lemonade. They saw Two-eyes sweep up the leftovers and throw them in the garbage can.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The mother and the two sisters looked at each other in astonishment. Something was wrong here!</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The mother leaned over to One-Eye and said: &#39;You come with me to the meadow tomorrow.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">I think something happened there that makes Two-Eyes not want to eat those leftovers, so pay close attention.&#39; The next day One-Eye walked with me to the meadow. Two-Eye understood why.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Now One-Eye was not used to walking so much, so when they arrived at the meadow she was quite tired. &#39;Go and rest on this soft grass,&#39; said Two-Eyes to One-Eye, &#39;and I will sing you a song.&#39; A little later One-Eye was sleeping peacefully. Just to be sure, Two-Eyes said:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s41" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One-eye, are you awake?</p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One-eye, are you sleeping?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One-Eye said nothing, he slept like a baby.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Two-Eyes walked over to her goat and said: &#39;Goat, please, table set!&#39; The table appeared again, now with delicious oliebollen and custard and apple lemonade.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">When she had eaten everything she woke One-Eye and together they walked back home.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At home, Two-Eyes immediately started working on the pots and pans. The mother took</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">One-Eye by the arm and asked: &#39;What happened there in the meadow? Did you see anything special?&#39; One-Eye said that she had fallen asleep and therefore had not seen anything.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Then the mother said to Three-Eyes: &#39;Then you will come with me to the meadow tomorrow. Don&#39;t fall asleep and keep your three eyes open!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">The next day, Little Three-Eyes walked along to the meadow. Little Three-Eyes was also not used to walking so far, so Little Two-Eyes told her to lie down in the grass and that she would sing a song for her. After a while Little Two-Eyes asked:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s42" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Three-eyes, are you awake?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_103.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But then she made a mistake and instead of &#39;Three-Eyes, are you sleeping?&#39; she said:</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s42" style="padding-left: 8pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Two-eyes, are you sleeping?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">So now only two eyes were asleep, and the third was not. And that third eye saw how Two-Eyes walked to the goat and said something to it, and that suddenly there was a little table in the meadow with apple balls and chocolate cakes on it and a big glass of milk.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">When Two-Eyes had eaten everything, she woke Three-Eyes and together with the goat they walked home.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At home, Three-Eyes immediately ran to her mother and told her what she had seen.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;Well, well,&quot; said the mother, &quot;so my own daughter is fooling me! She cooks potatoes and vegetables for us and the lady herself eats apple fritters and chocolate cakes. I&#39;ll teach her!&quot; She took a knife from the kitchen drawer and slaughtered the goat.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The next day, Two-Eyes sat in the garden and cried buckets of tears.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Suddenly the old woman stood before her again. &#39;Why are you crying, girl?&#39; she asked.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“They slaughtered the goat,” the girl said between sobs.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">&quot;Don&#39;t cry any more. Bury the goat in the front yard, then you&#39;ll see something,&quot; said the old woman, and she was gone again. When it was evening, Two-Eyes buried the goat in the front yard. What good is that for? she thought…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The next morning there was a tree with silver leaves on that spot, and between the leaves hung golden apples. The mother and the two sisters were delighted. They did not understand where the tree had suddenly appeared, but they did not care.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One-eye and Three-eye climbed the tree to pick the golden apples. But they</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">couldn&#39;t do it, because every time they reached for an apple, the branch would swing away. After fifteen minutes, they hadn&#39;t been able to pick up a single apple, and the tree was full of them!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_104.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Two-Eyes saw this and asked if she could try it. &#39;Hahaha,&#39; said the mother mockingly, &#39;if they can&#39;t do it, what can you do? But go ahead, try it.&#39; Two-Eyes climbed into the tree and picked one apple after another. The mother and</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">her two sisters were astonished.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">And who happened to ride by, just as Two-Eyes had climbed down from the tree again? A prince on a white horse. He stopped to admire the silver tree. The mother quickly put a rain barrel over Two-Eyes, because, well, he looked so ordinary, and she was ashamed of it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I should like to have a branch of that beautiful tree,” said the prince politely.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">&quot;Of course, Your Highness!&quot; said the mother. &quot;Quick, Three-Eyes, climb into the tree and break off a branch for His Highness.&quot; Three-Eyes climbed into</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">the tree, but even now every branch swung aside, just as she tried to grab it. And it was the same with One-Eye.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">When the mother saw that the prince wanted to ride on, she said quickly, &#39;I have another daughter who can try.&#39; And she fetched Two-Eyes from under the water-butt. Two-Eyes climbed into the tree, took a branch, broke it off, and gave it to the prince.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Thank you, dear beautiful girl,” said the prince.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Two-Eyes didn&#39;t know what she heard! Did the prince say that she was sweet and beautiful? No one had ever said that to her before! She blushed.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">&quot;You may make a wish,&quot; said the prince, &quot;and I will try to grant it.&quot; &quot;I only get scraps to eat here,&quot; said the girl, &quot;I wish someone would take me away.&quot; &quot;I will grant your wish</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">at once,&quot; said the prince. He lifted her onto his horse and rode off to his castle, where he married her a few weeks later.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The mother and the two sisters looked at them with open mouths. For a moment they were quite sullen, because they realized that from now on they would have to cook and clean themselves. And then they remembered that they fortunately</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">still had that wonderful silver tree with its golden apples.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the next day the tree was gone, and they never found out where it went.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And what did Two-Eyes see the next day when she looked out of her castle window? Yes, a silver tree with golden apples! It had simply moved with her.</p><p style="padding-left: 94pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_105.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="267" height="45" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_106.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s43" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 36pt;text-align: left;">The red stone</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 40pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 135%;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO, far away from here, there once was a poor man boy who lived alone in a tiny hut. All he had was a little chicken, which he</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">loved very much. During the day it scratched around the yard and at night, when</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">it got cold, it slept close to the boy in bed.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the chicken was already old and one day it died…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The boy was very sad. In the forest he dug a hole to bury the chicken. Just then two old men came by, who wanted to give him three coins for the dead chicken.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">The boy thought it strange – three coins for a dead chicken – but then again, money is money, and he was poor. He thought about it for a moment and was about to say, “Yes, that’s right,” when an old woman – perhaps a fairy – whispered in his ear that he had better not do that. They were two wicked magicians,</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">she said, and they only wanted the chicken because there was a red magic stone in its beak.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">So the boy quickly said &#39;no&#39; to the two old men and ran home with his chicken under his arm. There he indeed took a red pebble from her beak.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark28">It looked like a perfectly normal red stone. There was nothing special about it. The boy looked at it from all sides. What did you do with a magic stone?</a></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">And more importantly, what miracles could it do? He shook it. He tapped it. He turned it over three times. Nothing happened. He rubbed it, and then…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: -1pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Yes, then suddenly he heard a voice saying, &#39;Anything you wish for, you shall have. Just tell me what you want.&#39;</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&#39;I want my little hen to live again,&#39; said the boy quickly.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">And there the little hen lifted her head, stretched her legs, and began to scratch about again.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">&quot;And I want a nice bowl of soup,&quot; said the boy. And lo and behold, there was a bowl of steaming bean soup in front of him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_107.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">&quot;And a basket of corn kernels for the chicken, because she loves them.&quot; And there was a basket full of corn kernels.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“And I want a big house,” said the boy.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And the tiny hut was a big house. &#39;Now I want a chest full of money,&#39; said the boy. And sure enough, in the corner of the room stood a big chest full of gold coins.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Now there was no stopping him. He wanted everything: a big bed, a soft mattress, a down blanket, a thick carpet, you name it. Within half an hour he also had a palace, ten closets full of expensive clothes, a stable with thirty horses and a retinue of servants.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">Now all I need is a beautiful woman, he thought, and then I&#39;ll have everything I want. He had one of his many servants pour a glass of fresh lemonade and sent him to the king&#39;s palace to say that he wanted to marry the princess. The king was surprised.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Just someone who wanted to marry his daughter. What was that man thinking?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The servant told him that his boss was very rich, perhaps even richer than the king himself, but that was not enough for the king.</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 120%;text-align: left;">&#39;He may be rich,&#39; he said to his daughter, &#39;but I must first see what kind of man he is.&#39; But the princess thought that was not</p><p class="s11" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">necessary at all. He was very rich, and that was enough for her. The father hesitated, but then the princess became angry. She stamped her foot and shouted that she wanted to marry</p><p class="s11" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">him, and TOMORROW!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">Now the king loved his daughter very much, and therefore she had her way in everything.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Very unwise of him, because she had been a sweetheart as a little girl, and now she was a spoiled brat. But that&#39;s just the way some fathers are.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">First, golden times dawned for her, because her new husband spoiled her too, perhaps even more than the king. She got everything she wanted, and she wanted a lot: dresses, bags, shoes, more dresses, more bags, more shoes. It didn&#39;t stop.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Meanwhile, those two evil wizards had not been idle and had found out that the boy from the dead chicken was now married</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_108.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">with the princess. They still wanted that red pebble, so they came up with</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">a plan. They made a special doll – one that could dance, talk and bend. The doll was so special that the princess soon heard about it and of course she wanted it right away. But the two wizards only wanted to exchange the doll. And for the red pebble.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">&quot;The red pebble?&quot; asked the princess. &quot;What kind of red pebble?&quot; &quot;The pebble your husband always wears on a silken cord around his neck,&quot; they said.</p><p class="s3" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 142%;text-align: left;">That night, in bed, the princess said she would wear the stone for a while. Her husband did not want to have another shouting match, so the next day the princess gave the stone to the magicians and she got the doll.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The wizards immediately hurried to their house in the forest, where they rubbed the pebble and wished that the boy would lose everything he had ever wished for. So the boy was suddenly poor again and living in his tiny hut.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">And the princess? She was furious. She screamed that she had always thought he was a ZERO, and that she was going back to her father NOW and</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">that she NEVER wanted to see him again. The boy was left alone and very unhappy.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He understood that the magicians had the stone and decided to go and</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">look for them in the forest, where he had first encountered them. He wasted no time and set off at once.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">Towards evening he sat down, dead tired, under a large oak tree. Suddenly a small voice sounded. &#39;Why do you look so sad?&#39; The boy</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">looked around, but saw no one.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Why do you look so sad?&quot; he heard again. It was a wood mouse.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">&#39;Ah,&#39; said the boy, and he told the whole sad story. &#39;In fact, you have only yourself to blame for all this,&#39; said the wood mouse, &#39;but come on, I will help you. I know where the wizards live.&#39; In front</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">of the wizards&#39; house they hid among the ferns. There they waited until nightfall, and when all the lights were out, the wood mouse whispered: &#39;Now they are asleep.&#39;</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He crawled in under the front door, looking for the pebble.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">In the bedroom he saw something twinkling in the moonlight. It</p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">was the pebble, which was in a ring, and the ring was on the finger of one of the snoring wizards. When the wood mouse tried to get the ring off the finger, it accidentally bit the finger itself. The wizard woke up</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">and muttered: &#39;That ring pinches!&#39; He took it off and put it on the bedside table.</p><p class="s15" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">A little later the mouse was outside again and the boy had his stone back. &#39;I have wished for the wrong things,&#39; said the boy to himself. &#39;All this wealth has brought me no happiness. I must do things differently now.&#39; He rubbed the ring and said, &#39;I wish for two donkeys, with which I can earn my own bread, and nothing else. Oh yes, one more thing. I wish my hen were a nice girl, whom I could marry.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s15" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 115%;text-align: left;">And so it happened. They lived happily ever after. But the girl baked corn cakes very often… <span><img width="15" height="19" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_109.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_110.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s44" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 76pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: center;">The golden goose</p><h2 style="padding-top: 15pt;padding-left: 9pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 23pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO there was a poor woodcutter who had three</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 34pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">sons. He was quite pleased with the two oldest boys, but he thought his youngest son was stupid, so he conveniently called him Domoor. Imagine being called &#39;Domoor&#39; all day long!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">One day the woodcutter became ill, so ill that he had to stay in bed.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Because he could not go to the forest to chop wood, he sent his eldest son out. His mother gave the boy a delicious egg cake and a bottle of wine. He had hardly entered the forest when he saw an old crooked man sitting on a tree stump. &#39;If you give me something to eat and drink,&#39; said the little man, &#39;I will reward you.&#39; How can such an old crooked man reward me? thought the eldest</p><p style="padding-left: 6pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">son to himself. I will keep that delicious egg cake and that bottle of wine for myself!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 11pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And he went further into the forest. There he chose a big tree, but when he wanted to cut it down, he accidentally cut his hand. In pain he dropped the axe and ran back home crying.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 22pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark29">Now the second son had to go to the forest. For him too the mother baked a delicious egg cake and he too was given a bottle of wine, and once he arrived in the forest</a></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">he too saw the old crooked man sitting there.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">&quot;If you give me something to eat and drink,&quot; said the little man again, &quot;I will reward you.&quot; &quot;If I</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">give you something, there will be less left for me, so I will keep that delicious egg cake and that bottle of wine for myself,&quot; said the second son. He also walked further into the forest and looked for a suitable tree to cut down, but guess what? The second son cut his foot and limped home groaning.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Then the youngest son said that he would go to the forest to chop wood.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_111.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;Oh, you&#39;re much too stupid for that, Simpleton!&#39; said his father. &#39;If your brothers can&#39;t do it, you certainly won&#39;t!&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">But the youngest son went anyway. His mother only gave him a dry crust of bread and a bottle of water from the well, he thought that was all fine. With an axe over his shoulder he walked whistling into the forest. Soon he saw the old crooked man sitting on the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">tree stump.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">“If you give me something to eat and drink,” said the little man, “I will reward you.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 18pt;text-align: left;">&#39;Oh, that&#39;s not necessary at all,&#39; said the youngest son cheerfully. &#39;I got a crust of bread from my mother and a bottle of water from the well.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">We can share that together.&#39; The</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">old man ate some of the crust of bread and drank some from the bottle, and then said to the boy: &#39;Soon you will see a sick old tree, which is so weak that you do not have to</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">cut it down. If you push it, it will fall down of its own accord. Between its roots you will find a reward that will give you much pleasure.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Simpleton didn&#39;t have to walk far. Soon he saw an old tree, which was completely gray. He pushed against the trunk and the tree fell over. And what did he see there between the roots? A goose!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Simpleton could see at once that it was no ordinary goose, for the creature glistened and shone on all sides. He had never seen anything like it: the goose&#39;s feathers were of gold!</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">It was now almost dark, too late to go home, so the youngest son walked into an inn to spend the night. He was so tired that he went straight to bed and fell asleep immediately.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Now the innkeeper had three daughters. The eldest daughter had seen the goose and thought: I should like to have a golden feather for my Sunday hat. The second daughter thought: I should like to have a golden feather for my new belt. And the third daughter thought: I should like to have some golden feathers to put in my hair.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_112.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">At midnight the eldest daughter tiptoed to Simpleton&#39;s room. The goose was sitting on a cupboard next to the bed. The girl carefully tried to pull a feather out of its tail, but she couldn&#39;t. Instead, to her horror, she was stuck to the goose! No matter how hard</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">she pulled and tugged - without making a sound, of course - she couldn&#39;t get loose. A little later the second daughter slipped into the room, also looking for a golden feather, and she was very surprised to see her eldest sister standing there.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">“I’m stuck,” whispered the eldest daughter, “pull me loose, and quickly please!” The second daughter pulled on her sister’s shoulder and… oh dear, she got stuck to the arm!</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">There came the youngest daughter already sneaking up. She tugged at the second daughter&#39;s dress and... yes, she got stuck to the dress.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The next morning, Simpleton woke up and to his astonishment saw the three daughters standing there. &#39;Look,&#39; he muttered, &#39;I knew there was something special about that goose.&#39; He took the animal under his arm and walked out the door, with the three girls following behind him.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">They didn&#39;t feel like it at all, so they did everything they could to get away from</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">the goose and from each other, but they couldn&#39;t. They had to go, whether they wanted to or not.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">They had barely left the village when they ran into the priest. &#39;Leave that boy alone!&#39; he said sternly to the girls. He tried to pull the youngest daughter away, but… stuck to her sleeve.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Just outside the village the sexton came walking.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;But Father,&quot; he cried, &quot;where are you going? We have a wedding coming up and we</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">have to get to church.&quot; He grabbed the priest by the sleeve, and… he couldn&#39;t get away.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Luckily, two farmers just arrived.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">“Hey there,” shouted the sexton, “please pull us loose!” One farmer pulled on the sexton’s jacket, the second farmer pulled on the first farmer’s trousers and – you guessed it – they both got stuck.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">There they went, in a long line one after the other: Domoor, the three daughters of the innkeeper, the pastor, the sexton and lastly the two farmers.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">And if they were still walking calmly, but no, they pushed, pulled, punched and kicked each other to get loose. And in the meantime they shouted at Domoor to stop, but Domoor walked on whistling, as if nothing was wrong.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">So they passed the king&#39;s palace. The gatekeeper, seeing the procession approaching, began to laugh terribly. &#39;You must definitely visit the king&#39;s daughter,&#39; he said.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;She has not laughed for three years and the king is desperate. Whoever makes her laugh may marry her, he has said.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Dom did not hesitate for a moment. He walked with the three girls, the priest, the sexton and the two farmers behind him across the drawbridge to the palace, where the princess sat sadly behind the window. When she saw the strange</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">procession entering the garden she had to smile a little and when Dom came closer she started to roar with laughter.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The king was so happy that Dumb was allowed to marry the princess that same day. And they lived happily ever after. So it was a good thing that Dumb, who was now called Prince, was so generous and kind, otherwise he would still be at home with his</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="15" height="19" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_113.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">father, who called him &#39;Dumb&#39; all day long. Then you would rather be married to a princess, wouldn&#39;t you?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="252" height="37" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_114.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s13" style="padding-left: 4pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 26pt;text-align: left;">The three dogs</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG AGO and far away from here, there once lived an old</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 34pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">poor shepherd. Except for a daughter and a son, he had a little house and three sheep, and nothing else. One day he became very ill and died…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">When they had buried their father, the son asked his sister, &#39;What do you want, the house or the three sheep?&#39; The girl chose the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">house.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;That&#39;s just as well,&quot; said the boy, &quot;because I&#39;ve always wanted to see something of the world. This is my chance.&quot; He took the three sheep from the fold, walked out of the yard, and set out.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">After walking for hours and hours, he came across a man who had three large black dogs with him.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;What beautiful sheep you have there,&#39; said the man. &#39;Shall we trade, you my dogs and I your sheep?&#39; &#39;No,&#39; said the boy.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;You have to feed dogs and I haven&#39;t got a red cent. Sheep find their own food.&#39; &#39;Go ahead,&#39; said the man, &#39;because these are</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">three wonder dogs. The biggest one is called Salt. If you want something to eat, he</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">will get it for you. The second is called Pepper; he is a champion fighter. And the third is Mustard. He can break iron between his jaws.&#39; Well, the boy wanted such special</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">dogs! So a little later he walked</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">on, now with three dogs instead of three sheep behind him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark30">The road went up, the landscape became grim. Dark clouds drifted low over the black mountains. It was deathly quiet. You could only hear the wind.</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Behind the boy came a pitch-black carriage. Absolutely everything about it was black – the coachman was dressed in black, the two horses were black, and even the reins were black leather. In the carriage sat a beautiful girl – also dressed completely in black. She was crying.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The boy stood in the middle of the road and stopped the carriage. &#39;What&#39;s the matter?&#39; he asked. &#39;Why is everything and everyone in black? And who is</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_115.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">that girl, and why is she crying so?&#39; &#39;That is none of your business,&#39; growled the coachman. &#39;Out of the way, you!&#39; And he struck the boy with the whip.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The girl leaned out of the window. &#39;I am the king&#39;s daughter,&#39; she said. &#39;You had better not interfere. Do you see that cave over there? There lives a horrible dragon there. He</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">wants a girl to eat every year.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">If he doesn&#39;t get that, he&#39;ll destroy the whole country. Now it&#39;s my turn to be eaten.&#39; The girl sat down again and</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">the carriage drove on.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Well, the boy felt very sorry for the princess. So he ran after the carriage, and when</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">it stopped, he and his three dogs followed the princess into the cave. It was so dark that at first they could see nothing at all. From the darkness before them came a deep, heavy growl. And suddenly there stood the dragon! He spread his wings wide,</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">scratched the rocky ground with his claws, opened his mouth wide and…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">&quot;Pepper!&quot; cried the boy. &quot;Get him!&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Pepper leaped at the dragon&#39;s throat and bit down. Blood spurted everywhere. The dragon roared and swung its head angrily to shake the dog off. It tried to tear Pepper to pieces with its claws, but it was no use at all. The boy and the princess had to be careful not to be hit by the lashing tail, but finally, after hours of fighting, the dragon fell dead.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s6" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">down.</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">The princess embraced the boy and told him to come with her to her father, because the king had said that whoever would save his daughter from the dragon would be allowed to marry her.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The boy said, &quot;I would like to marry you, but not now. I want to see more of the world first. I will come back in three years.&quot; He kissed her and left.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The coachman, who had heard the roar, had remained safely outside and now saw the princess emerge from the cave, safe and sound. She got into the carriage and they started on the return journey. On a bridge, high above a wide river, the coachman stopped and said menacingly to the princess: &#39;I am going to tell your father that I have saved</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">you. Then you must marry me. You promise me now that you will never tell him the truth, or I will throw you into the river now.&#39;</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_116.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The princess looked into the depths. What else could she do but promise, because she could not swim…</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">At home the king embraced his daughter. He was overjoyed to see her alive again and said: &#39;I have said that your rescuer may marry you. The wedding is the day after tomorrow.&#39; And he patted the coachman approvingly on the shoulder. Of course the princess could not say that the coachman had not saved her at all, because she had</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">promised that, and a princess always does what she promises. But she did think of a trick.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">&quot;I am much too young to marry, father,&quot; she said. &quot;Let us postpone it for a year.&quot; The coachman</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">would hear nothing of it, of course, but the king also thought his daughter was too young and postponed the wedding.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">After a year the princess said: &#39;Father, I still feel too young to marry. Let us postpone it for another year.&#39; The coachman was beside himself with anger, but the king agreed with his daughter.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The following year the princess said for the third time that she was too young to marry. But now the king said: &#39;That is well. We will postpone it for one more year, but then I will not hear of any more postponement. For that is what I promised your savior.&#39; Yes… and then the following year came. And yes… now the princess had to marry. On the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">appointed day there was a celebration throughout the country. The bells rang, the people danced in the streets and everyone was merry. Except the princess, of course. She</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">sat sadly next to the coachman at the banquet. She only hoped that the boy with the dogs would keep his word. After all, he would return after three years?</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">She didn&#39;t know that he had arrived in the city at that very moment. He saw all the happy people and asked why there was a party.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&#39;Three years ago the princess was saved from the dragon by a coachman,&#39; was the answer, &#39;and today they are to be married.&#39; &#39;That</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">man is a liar!&#39; cried the boy. &#39;I saved her!&#39; But the people did not believe him and became angry. The gendarmes even had to intervene, because on this festive day it was forbidden to quarrel.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The boy was thrown into prison with his dogs. When they were alone, the boy said to Mustard: &#39;Mustard, bite the bars!&#39;</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It was done in a moment. After some crunching and cracking, the boy crept out of the</p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 157%;text-align: left;">prison, and the dogs crept after him. He had eaten nothing since morning, and was now very hungry. &#39;Salt,&#39; he whispered, &#39;go and get me something to eat!&#39; And Salt was gone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 157%;text-align: left;">The dog entered the royal banquet hall and took a roasted chicken from the royal table. The princess recognized the dog, jumped up and ran after him.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 157%;text-align: left;">She found the boy a street away and took him back to the palace. &#39;Father,&#39; she said, &#39;this is my savior. And not that stupid coachman.&#39; And then she told him everything.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 156%;text-align: left;">The wedding went ahead as planned, but now with the boy as the groom instead of the coachman.</p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 156%;text-align: left;">And what happened to the coachman? He went to jail. And the dogs? They suddenly disappeared without a trace and no one knew where they had gone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s9" style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 149%;text-align: left;">Is there anything to learn from this fairy tale? <span class="s45">Yes!</span> Get your swimming diploma! <span><img width="19" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_117.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="208" height="37" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_118.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 3pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 33pt;text-align: left;">Bluebeard</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><h2 style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 60pt;text-align: left;">L</h2><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p style="padding-left: 41pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">ANG, A LONG TIME AGO, in a land far, far away, there was</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 34pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Once upon a time there was a rich man who was called Bluebeard. On his head his hair was just black, and his moustache and his thick eyebrows were pitch black, but his beard was really completely blue. He lived far away in a dark castle, which had more than seventy rooms and was therefore much, much too big for him alone. That was also the reason why he was looking for a wife, or rather: he was looking for another</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">wife, because he had already been married a few times before. By the way, no one knew what had happened to those women…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">So when he saw a beautiful girl walking by, he went to visit the father and asked</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">if he could marry the girl. If this rich man marries my daughter, thought the father, I might get some of his money and become rich myself. Well, he wanted that, so he didn&#39;t hesitate for a second and said straight away: &#39;Yes!&#39; He didn&#39;t even ask his</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">daughter what she thought about it! Perhaps on purpose, because he could see that she was a little afraid of Bluebeard. And that was not so strange, because Bluebeard had scary eyes and a bad temper.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">No one had ever seen him laugh, and then of course there was that strange blue beard…</p><p style="padding-left: 5pt;text-indent: 1pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark31">The wedding was celebrated, but before the girl left for the castle with the seventy rooms, she whispered quickly to her three brothers: &#39;If you hear me cry for help, come to me at once!&#39; The brothers promised, and with a knot in her stomach the girl</a></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">got into the carriage. It was three days&#39; drive through dense forests and misty marshes, and then the girl sat there, alone with Bluebeard in the great, gloomy castle,</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">far away from everything and everyone.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">A month later, Bluebeard had to travel unexpectedly. He gave her a large bunch of keys. &#39;Here are the keys to all the rooms,&#39; he said. &#39;You may go anywhere except one room. This small key is to a room in the</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_119.jpg"/></span></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">cellar, and that is the only room you may not enter. The door is red, so you cannot make a mistake. If you do look into that room, I will punish you severely.&#39; With these words Bluebeard mounted his horse and left.</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">The girl was curious and immediately tried out all the keys. She didn’t know that there were so many types of rooms – one had red wallpaper, another green, the third had a marble floor and the fourth had expensive carpets on the wall. Every day she saw</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: justify;">new rooms, walked through new corridors. Up and down stairs she went, and suddenly, before she knew it, she was standing in the cellar in front of the forbidden red door…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">It wasn&#39;t a big door, no, it was a very ordinary door. She felt the rough wood and the big black hinges. How strange, really, that she wasn&#39;t allowed in there.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">That night she couldn&#39;t sleep. She kept thinking about that room. What was in there? Why wasn&#39;t she allowed to know?</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Fortunately, her sister Anna came to stay, so she had something else to</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">think about, and together the sisters wandered through the castle. They looked at all the rooms, but the girl said nothing about the room in the cellar.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">On the day before Bluebeard was to come home, she could no longer contain her curiosity. While her sister Anna was taking a nap,</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">she took the little key and tiptoed down the stairs to the cellar. For a long time she stood in front of the red door, her heart pounding, holding the little key in her trembling hand. I&#39;m just going to push it, thought the girl, maybe it isn&#39;t locked at all.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the door was locked…</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">I&#39;m just going to try the key to see if it fits, thought the girl, you never know, it might be the wrong key. But the key fit perfectly...</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">And if I just turn it a little bit… She held her breath as the door slowly and creaked open.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">It was quite dark inside. She stepped into the room and screamed in fright. There were coffins all over! The girl wanted to leave the room quickly, but dropped the key. She quickly picked it up and in a blink of an eye she had closed the door behind her and locked it.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="815" height="1055" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_120.jpg"/></span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Back in her bedroom, she was shocked to see that there was blood on the key. No matter how hard she scrubbed and scrubbed, with soap and a steel brush, it wouldn’t come off! She wrapped it in a handkerchief and hid it far away in a deep drawer.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Tomorrow Bluebeard would come home and what if he asked for the little key…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">The girl didn&#39;t know what to do! All night long she paced back and forth, back and forth through the room.</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">The next morning very early she heard the outer gate open. Heavy steps sounded in the hall and a moment later he stood before her. The girl was so frightened that she immediately burst into tears. Bluebeard understood at once what was happening.</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The bunch of keys was on the table and the small key was not among them…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 7pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">&quot;You&#39;ve been in the cellar,&quot; he said, &quot;so now I must punish you. I warned you!&quot; He drew his sword and was about to stab her to death, but the girl dropped to her knees and begged to be allowed to pray in her room for a moment.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Two minutes and not a second longer,” said Bluebeard.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The girl ran up the stairs – not to her own room, but to her sister Anna&#39;s room. There</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">she called out of the window: &#39;Oh dear, dear brothers, where are you? Help me, help me!&#39; The brothers, who happened to be riding on their horses nearby, heard this. They immediately turned around and galloped to the castle.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">Meanwhile the girl said to her sister: &#39;Quick, Sister Anna, climb into the highest tower and see if you can see them coming.&#39; Anna gathered her skirts together and ran up the</p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 136%;text-align: left;">spiral staircase. The girl herself remained in the room and quickly pushed the bolt across the door.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“The two minutes are almost up!” shouted Bluebeard impatiently from below.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The girl called out anxiously, &quot;Sister Anna, Sister Anna, do you see anything coming?&quot;</p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">And from</p><p style="padding-top: 8pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">the very top of the tower Anna called down, &quot;I see nothing, only trees and a dark sky.&quot; &quot;The two minutes are up!&quot; shouted</p><p style="padding-top: 6pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Bluebeard.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 110%;text-align: left;">“Oh Anna, Sister Anna, don&#39;t you see anything coming yet?” the girl cried again in a trembling voice.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">&quot;No, no,&quot; Anna cried back, &quot;I see only mountains and black clouds.&quot; &quot;Come down now, or I will come and get you!&quot; shouted Bluebeard.</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">“Anna, oh Anna, do you still see nothing coming?” cried the girl, now weeping. &#39;Yes, yes,&#39; cried Anna, cheering, &#39;I see a cloud of dust, fast approaching.&#39; &#39;Now I will come for you,&#39; roared Bluebeard, and he rushed up the stairs with his sword. He cut a hole in the door and squeezed his way in. In three strides he was at the girl, and with both hands he raised his sword, ready to stab her to death…</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">At that moment the three brothers rushed in and stabbed Bluebeard to death. The girl threw her arms around her brothers, crying. She was saved! That was what you call a close call. The girl was now very rich, but she would not stay in the castle for anything. She bought another castle (one without a cellar), which may not have been as big, but it was much more pleasant.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: -1pt;line-height: 125%;text-align: left;">You can probably guess who was in those coffins: the girls Bluebeard had married before, and who had all been just as curious as the girl in this story! It is a wonder that this story ends so well.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s27" style="padding-bottom: 4pt;padding-left: 7pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But the one who really deserved a good beating was the girl&#39;s father.</p><p style="padding-left: 46pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 11pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="18" height="15" alt="image" src="sprookje-eng-1/Image_121.jpg"/></span></p></body></html>
